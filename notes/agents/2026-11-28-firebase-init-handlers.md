# Firebase initialization handlers refactor

**Challenge:** Moving the initialization state helpers into `index.js` risked breaking the cache reset hook used by `firestore.js` while also introducing circular imports.

**Resolution:** I relocated the state flag and its helpers to `index.js`, added a lightweight registration mechanism in `firebaseApp.js`, and registered the reset handler during module setup so cached Firestore instances still clear the initialization flag safely.
