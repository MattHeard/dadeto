# Entry/Core Vision Bridge Documentation Refresh
- **Challenge:** Needed to highlight an existing browser bridge that already matches the dependency-injection vision without overstating any code changes.
- **Resolution:** Reviewed `src/browser/main.js` and `src/browser/loadStaticConfig.js` to confirm both files construct environment factories before delegating to their core modules, then documented those examples in the vision note.
