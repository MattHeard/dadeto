## Coverage tuning for core credit fetcher

- **Challenge:** Several Firestore helper modules in `src/core/cloud/get-api-key-credit*` had zero branch coverage, and the csv toy tripped the strict ESLint complexity rule for inline callbacks.
- **Resolution:** Added focused Jest suites that exercise missing branches and re-export modules, then rewrote the CSV toy loop to use a plain `for...of` block so we could stage lint fixes without adding new warnings.
