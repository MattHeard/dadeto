Focused work on the 2025-12-05 toy petals surfaced two surprising coverage blind spots. The visibility helper never hit the normalize branch for non-plain `ratings` objects, and the admin-check fallback and clamp-distance guard only lived in unreachable branches, so I had to export `hasAdminRating`/`clampDistance` and add dedicated tests that feed malformed payloads and non-boolean page scores to exercise those guards. Likewise, Dijkstra’s `guardStopDistance` and node list builder had no coverage because the normal path never hit them, so I exported and invoked them directly to prove they behave as intended, and added a path where duplicates appear so the “already visited” guard actually runs.

This work landed new Jest suites for `edgeWeight`, `dijkstra`, and additional visibility cases, plus the helper exports. After the edits I reran `npm test -- test/toys/2025-12-05` to confirm the 2025-12-05 toy bundle now reports 100% coverage. The helpers should stay available for future tests if new edge cases appear.

Open questions/follow-ups: keep an eye on whether the new helper exports become part of the public API surface (so far they are just for tests), and if the toy coverage bottleneck shifts to other branches when the generator logic evolves.
