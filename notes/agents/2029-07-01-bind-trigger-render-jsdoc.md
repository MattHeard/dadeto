# Bind trigger render JSDoc cleanup

- Ran `npm run lint` to capture current warnings; it auto-generated a huge report and touched many files, so I reverted the unrelated changes afterwards.
- Targeted the missing parameter documentation in `src/core/browser/admin/core.js` and added the required type/description for `elementId`.
- Confirmed the lint report now shows zero jsdoc warnings for that file and tallied the remaining `src/core` warnings for the summary.
