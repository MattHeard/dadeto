# Remove variant HTML complexity reduction

*Unexpected hurdle:* rerunning `npm run lint` streams the entire report to stdout and looked like it hung. I almost aborted it again before realizing the command simply needs time to dump hundreds of warnings. Patience (and avoiding another Ctrl+C) let the run finish so I could confirm the new complexity numbers.

*Diagnosis and options:* once I saw the previous report, it was clear that `removeVariantHtml` mixed several responsibilities: normalizing loader output, choosing variant data, and orchestrating deletion. I considered early returns inside the existing function, but that still left a long chain of conditionals. Extracting small helpers to normalize the loader payload and resolve variant data let me drop multiple nested checks without duplicating logic.

*Guidance for the next agent:* if you need fresh lint data, kick off `npm run lint` and give it a minuteâ€”the `cat reports/lint/lint.txt` tail step is noisy but eventually exits. For similar refactors, isolate data-shaping steps into dedicated helpers first; once the orchestration function just wires dependencies together, ESLint's complexity count falls quickly while keeping behavior intact.

*Open question:* `removeVariantHtmlForSnapshot` still sits at complexity 7; the same helper approach should make it easier to tackle next time.
