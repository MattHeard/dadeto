# Remove redundant generate-stats admin config bridge

## Challenges
- Confirmed no production code depended on `src/cloud/generate-stats/admin-config.js` beyond a trivial re-export to the core config.

## Resolutions
- Used ripgrep to ensure only the deleted unit test referenced the cloud-level re-export before removing the file and its coverage test.
