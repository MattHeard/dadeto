The main surprise was how much of the toy plumbing was already present once the input value store and auto-submit polling were understood. The clean path was not to invent a separate game loop, but to treat keyboard events as serialized input payloads and let the existing auto-submit machinery keep invoking the toy. That reduced the feature to two small responsibilities: a capture widget that writes keyboard events into the hidden text input, and a toy that owns all game and key-state rules through `memoryLens`.

The second snag was verification scope. Adding a new input method changed generator output snapshots in a few places, and `npm run lint` also rewrote unrelated files during `--fix`. The safe approach was to keep the feature scoped: update the generator fixtures that legitimately changed, then revert the incidental formatting-only edits outside the feature area before reviewing the final diff. If a future toy adds another input mode, search the generator tests for the full hard-coded `<select class="input">...` string first so the suite stays aligned.

Follow-up: the repo still has existing lint warnings, and this change opened a separate bead to track that cleanup instead of mixing structural lint refactors into the gameplay feature.
