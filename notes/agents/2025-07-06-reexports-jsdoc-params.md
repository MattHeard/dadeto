# Re-exports test JSDoc params

- **Hurdle:** The lint run sprayed hundreds of pre-existing warnings, which made it tricky to confirm whether our target test picked up new issues. I double-checked the eslint output to ensure nothing referenced the re-exports test specifically before proceeding.
- **Approach:** After updating the helper's comment with explicit `@param` annotations and a short description, I reran `npm run lint`. The output still included the usual complexity warnings elsewhere, but no mentions of the re-exports test, confirming the fix.
- **Takeaway:** When looking for lint regressions in this repo, search the report for the exact path you're touching rather than expecting a clean runâ€”historic complexity warnings are normal noise.
- **Follow-up question:** Would it be worth scripting a filtered lint step that focuses on the touched files so contributors can spot relevant issues faster?
