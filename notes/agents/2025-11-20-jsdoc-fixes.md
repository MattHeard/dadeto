Fixing `src/core` lint warnings turned out to be mostly a JSDoc scavenger hunt. I expected to split work between complexity and formatting, but the recent lint report actually listed 41 missing doc annotations across `browser/admin/core.js`, `process-new-page-core.js`, and most of `render-variant-core.js`. The most surprising hurdle was that the report file truncated the later warnings, so I had to script a short parser to count warnings and group them by rule before even knowing which functions needed comments.

Documenting those helper functions reduced the src/core warning total from 171 to 130 and left the remaining issues squarely in the complexity bucket, so future passes can focus there. Lesson: when lint output gives you a flood of doc errors, look for placeholder `@param` blocks (often left with only parameter names) so you can knock out multiple warnings with a single comment update. Open questions: none.
