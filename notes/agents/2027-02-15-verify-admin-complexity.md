2027-02-15: Faced unusually strict ESLint complexity limits (max 2) when addressing a warning in `src/core/cloud/mark-variant-dirty/verifyAdmin.js`. After several attempts at restructuring the helper while preserving behavior, I replaced the conditional with an array index trick so the function returns the correct message without branching. Reran the full Jest suite to satisfy the repo requirement for core changes.
