# Lint warnings reduction

- **Unexpected hurdle:** The lint output was dominated by `jsdoc` complaints across large APIs (especially the `/get-api-key-credit-v2` core helpers) plus unused helpers glued into the browser admin tests. Tackling the `jsdoc` noise meant writing precise docs for each helper instead of quick hacks, and keeping signatures aligned with parameter names to keep `jsdoc/check-param-names` happy.
- **How I resolved it:** Documented every helper in `get-api-key-credit-v2-core` with descriptive `@param`/`@returns` entries, removed unused admin test imports, dropped unused mock helpers, and simplified the `process-new-page` fixtures so they no longer declare unused refs. Added JSDoc for the render-variant/reference helpers plus the render-contents utilities and the cloud submission author helpers; those edits pushed the warning count down to 214 (a ~39% reduction). Each round was followed by `npm run lint` and `npm test` to guard regression risk.
- **Lessons for next time:** When `jsdoc` rules spell out each parameter, keep docs next to the function to avoid drift. Reviewing `reports/lint/lint.txt` (not just the console summary) helps spot groups of related warnings to batch-fix. Removing unused test scaffolding is a fast win that reduces noise before touching complex source files.
- **Open questions:** Should we prioritize the remaining modules with high complexity/javadoc warnings (e.g., `admin-core.js`, `generate-stats-core.js`) before the next agent arrives, or leave them for future targeted passes?
