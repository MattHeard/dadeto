# Lint follow-up

- Ran the full Jest suite to confirm branch coverage for `src/core/` stays at 100%.
- Lint highlighted many complexity warnings in `src/core`. Attempted to refactor `removeVariantHtml`, but it introduced extra lint issues due to strict complexity limits, so I reverted.
- Resolved an easier documentation warning instead by adding the missing JSDoc details for `readUuid` in the credit handler core module.
