## Summary
- Ran `npm test` to confirm coverage still at 100% for `src/core/`.
- Added JSDoc to `matchPathUuid` to begin chipping away at the new lint warnings in the core credit handler.
- Re-ran `npm run lint` to refresh `reports/lint/lint.txt` and count remaining core warnings (82 left).

## Challenges
- Complexity rules remain extremely strict; most remaining warnings in `src/core/` are for cyclomatic complexity > 2, so future work will require functional decomposition rather than quick fixes.
