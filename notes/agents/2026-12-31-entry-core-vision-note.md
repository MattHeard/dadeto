# Entry/Core Vision Note
- **Challenge:** Translating a narrative description of the desired dependency-injection pattern into a concise note required double-checking current cloud and browser entry files to avoid misrepresenting their structure.
- **Resolution:** Reviewed `src/cloud/get-moderation-variant/index.js` and `src/browser/main.js` to confirm the existing bridge/core split before drafting the documentation in `notes/entry-core-dependency-vision.md`.
