Unexpected gap: even with all suites green, coverage dipped to 99.9% because helper functions I added for lint work (e.g., `extractParams` and the sentinel catch blocks) introduced code paths our existing suites never exercised. Istanbul reports zero-line files as 0% too, so a single uncovered `throw` dragged the totals.

Diagnosis: used `npx eslint src/core --format json` earlier for linting, but for coverage I relied on the Jest summary. The three offenders surfaced in the coverage table (assign-moderation `catch`, mark-variant-dirty sentinel rethrow, render-variant params helper). Instrumentation showed exact line numbers, so I either wrote focused tests to hit those paths (e.g., forcing the workflow to reject) or simplified the helpers to avoid unnecessary branches.

What worked: add the smallest possible tests that exercise the missing branch (e.g., a parse function that throws) and, when a helper exists only to lower complexity, prefer inline optional chaining so we don’t need a separate “return {}” branch at all.

Open question: we still generate coverage for a lot of files that only export constants (e.g., `admin-config.js` shows 0/0). For future agents, it might be worth updating the Jest configuration to ignore those modules or add meta-tests so they stop polluting the report whenever tooling changes.***
