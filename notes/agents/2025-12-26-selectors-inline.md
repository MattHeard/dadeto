- **Unexpected hurdle:** Inlining the shared selectors directly inside `src/core/browser/browser-core.js` introduced a circular dependency because `src/core/browser/inputHandlers/createDendriteHandler.js` imports `browserCore` and needed the selectors before `browserCore` finished evaluating, which surfaced as TDZ `ReferenceError`s during the Jest run.
- **Diagnosis:** The errors vanished once I stopped destructuring the selectors at module scope and instead accessed `browserCore.DENDRITE_FORM_SELECTOR` lazily inside the handler functions after the module evaluation finished, so the TDZ no longer triggered while the circular graph was still warming up.
- **What I learned:** When moving cross-cutting constants into a module that already participates in a cycle, avoid binding them at import time in the dependent modules; reference them at runtime or via helper functions so evaluation order can settle first.
- **Open question:** Should we eventually replace `public/core/...` copies that still rely on `../constants/selectors.js` with the new layout, or is that legacy surface intentionally left untouched?
