TCR commit guard

- Updated `tcr.sh` so it checks `git commit`'s exit code before congratulating the user; failures now get surfaced instead of printing misleading success text.
- Ran `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run tsdoc:check` so the repo stays under the quality gate, and refreshed `tsdoc-check-output.txt` with the latest `tsc` failures since the list is still heavy.
- No additional branch coverage gaps remained, but ongoing tslint/tsdoc debts (presenters, tags, toys, cloud helpers) are still tracked by the existing beads mentioned in AGENTS.

Next steps: pick up whichever tsdoc/lint bead is next up the queue once the current tissue-free window closes; ensure future TCR runs honor the new guard so we can see the actual failure reason when a commit is rejected.
