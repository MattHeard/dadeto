# Firestore cache refactor reflections

- **Surprise:** Extracting the dependency-check logic triggered a wall of jsdoc warnings because eslint now expects full annotations for helper parameters. I had to revisit the helper and supply an explicit JSDoc block to calm the linter.
- **Diagnostic path:** I re-ran `npm run lint` after the extraction to verify the complexity drop and noticed the new rule violations. Reading the generated placeholder comment in the file made it obvious that ESLint auto-inserted stubs, which hinted at the missing documentation requirement.
- **Guidance for next time:** Whenever you add a helper in the cloud utilities, budget time to annotate it right awayâ€”the lint script is strict about param and return docs. Keeping the helper focused on a single responsibility (deciding whether to bypass the cache) also made it easier to confirm the complexity reduction.
- **Open question:** The broader codebase still has many high-complexity warnings. It might be worth scheduling incremental cleanups or relaxing the rule, because one-off fixes will keep re-triggering the noisy lint report.
