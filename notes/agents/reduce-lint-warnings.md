# Reducing ESLint noise
- **Unexpected hurdle:** The complexity rule was triggered by many helper functions just because of optional chaining and inline conditionals, so brute-force rewrites were noisier than expected. I diagnosed the rule by watching warnings reappear after the first edits and realized `?.`, `&&`, and multi-`if` bodies were counted even when the code otherwise felt simple.
- **How I addressed it:** I moved conditional checks into tiny helpers, replaced optional chaining with safe destructuring, and reused the existing `assertFunctionDependency` to keep single responsibilities in each function. That kept every exported helper under the threshold while still keeping behavior identical.
- **Learning / next steps:** Splitting logic into focused helpers not only eases ESLint’s calculation but also makes testing/inspection easier; future tweaks on similar modules can follow the same helper-led approach once the complexity rule bites. A follow-up idea is to document in `CLAUDE.md` when optional chaining may trigger noise so future agents can intentionally use helper wrappers instead.
- **Open question:** Should we consider providing a shared utility (e.g., `safeGetRequestBody`) across cloud modules to avoid rewriting the same guard logic every time, or is the duplication acceptable given the lint rule?
