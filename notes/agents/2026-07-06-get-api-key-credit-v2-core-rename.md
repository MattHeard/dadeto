# Agent Retrospective: get-api-key-credit-v2 core rename

- **Challenge:** Renaming the `get-api-key-credit-v2` core module required updating both the cloud re-export and the copy-to-infra script so deployments receive the implementation under the new filename.
- **Resolution:** Renamed the source files, updated all imports and tests to point at `get-api-key-credit-v2-core.js`, and adjusted the copy script to mirror the renamed module into the Cloud Function bundle.
