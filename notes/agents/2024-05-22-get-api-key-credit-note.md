# Agent Worklog - Get API Key Credit Firestore Wrapper

## Challenges
- Ensuring the new wrapper preserved the existing Firestore import contract without altering runtime behavior.

## Resolutions
- Added a dedicated `gcf.js` module that re-exports `Firestore` from `@google-cloud/firestore` and updated the primary handler to consume the new wrapper.
