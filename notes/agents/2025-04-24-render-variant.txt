Refactoring the cache invalidation flow required untangling the old inline fetch logic so it could be unit tested. The tricky part was designing the new core helper with injectable dependencies while still handling error logging consistently. I solved it by adding dependency validation inside `createInvalidatePaths` and covering both success and failure flows with targeted Jest tests.
