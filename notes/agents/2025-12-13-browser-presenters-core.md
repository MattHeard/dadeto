Moved the shared `<pre>` creation helper out of `pre.js` and into a dedicated `browserPresentersCore.js` file so other presenters can import it without dragging in the bracketed-list formatting utilities. This keeps each presenter focused on its own content generation and makes the helper easier to reuse in the wider presenter suite.

Duplication, lint, and Jest all pass after the move; we now reference `createPreFromContent` from `browserPresentersCore` in each file that needs it. Future work could look at other presenter helpers that are small DOM wrappers and consolidate them into `browserPresentersCore` as well to shrink the duplication report further.
