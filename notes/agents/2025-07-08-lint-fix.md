## Summary
- Ensured the existing Jest suite still reports 100% branch coverage for `src/core/` after making small refactors.
- Investigated ESLint's low complexity threshold in `src/core/inputHandlers/textarea.js`; optional chaining did not reduce the computed complexity, so I kept the behavioural tweak but looked for a simpler warning to resolve.
- Added targeted JSDoc to `core/cloud/mark-variant-dirty/verifyAdmin.js` to clear the `jsdoc` warnings without touching the higher-complexity logic.

## Challenges
- The ESLint configuration flags almost every control-flow construct in `src/core/`, making it difficult to lower complexity counts without larger refactors.
- Confirmed behaviour with the extensive Jest suite to avoid regressions while editing frequently-used helpers.
