## Summary
- Adjusted Firebase app manager usage to require an explicit initializer to avoid implicit dependencies.
- Ensured dependent Cloud Function entry points and Firestore utilities provide the initializer so shared state remains predictable.

## Hurdles
- Running the comprehensive Jest suite took a long time, so I tailed the log instead of streaming directly to keep the shell responsive.
- Needed to update many entry points; keeping the import ordering consistent across files helped avoid lint concerns.

## Follow-ups
- None noted beyond monitoring lint checks for import order preferences, but everything passed locally.
