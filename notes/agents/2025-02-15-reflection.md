# Reflection

- **Unexpected hurdle:** The linter surfaced that `submitModerationRatingResponder` ballooned to a complexity of 11, so simply sprinkling guard clauses was insufficient. Breaking apart the control flow without duplicating error responses required threading structured results between helpers.
- **Diagnosis:** I re-ran `npm run lint` and inspected `reports/lint/lint.txt` to confirm both the offending function and the specific branches contributing to the score. Mapping each early return to a category (method check, body validation, auth, assignment) made the natural extraction points obvious.
- **Resolution:** I carved out `validateRatingBody`, `resolveAuthorizationToken`, `resolveModeratorContext`, and `clearAssignment`. Each helper now returns either the necessary data or a prebuilt response, letting the main responder read like a linear pipeline.
- **Takeaway:** When taming complexity in this codebase, prefer helpers that encapsulate both validation and the associated error payload. That keeps the responder slim and avoids reintroducing branching noise when new error cases appear.
- **Open question:** Other responders (e.g., `submit-new-story`) still emit many complexity warnings. A shared pattern for these pipeline-style handlers could make future refactors faster.
