# Browser Google Sign-out Bridge Cleanup

## Challenge
Confirming that removing `src/browser/googleSignOut.js` would not break existing imports required auditing both source and infra copy scripts because the file previously acted as a compatibility re-export.

## Outcome
Tracked all remaining imports to `src/browser/googleAuth.js`, verified the bridge was unused via `rg`, and ensured the cloud copy script already targets the relocated core module before safely deleting the redundant file.
