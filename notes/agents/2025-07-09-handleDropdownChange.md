# Lint fix for handleDropdownChange

- Challenge: The lint report listed dozens of complexity warnings across `src/browser/toys.js`, so it was unclear whether updating one function resolved the violation without triggering unrelated failures.
- Resolution: Ran ESLint against the single file with an overridden complexity rule to confirm `handleDropdownChange` dropped below the threshold while avoiding unrelated fixes.
