Bead loop 2026-01-03
---------------------
- I worked through six ready tasks in a row (tsdoc strict mode plus five jsdoc fixes) and kept each bead in sync with the db (status updates, comments, closes).
- Unexpected friction: the `findValidationError` JSDoc needed the complexity comment to move so the doc block was adjacent to the function, otherwise the lint rule kept firing even after I added text. I also tripped on the shell interpreting backticks while writing bead comments—escaped the text by avoiding backticks in the message before retrying.
- Learned to treat lint warnings as part of the bead story, rerunning `npm run lint` after each fix and noting that most remain in other files; keeping the lint output in the bead comments keeps the next worker informed.
- Follow-up idea: the standing lint warnings (missing returns in many toy helpers) suggest a short batch of doc-string updates that could probably be scripted or templated for the remaining lines.
