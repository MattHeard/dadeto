# createCorsOriginFromEnvironment refactor

- **Challenge:** Needed to refactor `createCorsOriginFromEnvironment` so it reused the module's own `createCreateCorsOrigin` factory instead of expecting an injected function, without breaking the existing dependency wiring and test expectations.
- **Resolution:** Removed the injected dependency, updated the implementation and module consumers to rely on the local factory, and adjusted the unit tests accordingly. Verified the change with `npm test`.
