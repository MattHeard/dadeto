# Agent Notes - CSV Object Lint Fix

- **Challenge:** The ESLint rules flag very low complexity thresholds (max 2) for functions in `src/core`. The existing `csvToJsonObjectToy` implementation relied on a series of defensive `if` statements, triggering the complexity warning.
- **Resolution:** Introduced assertion and normalization helpers that encapsulate the individual checks, then funneled the successful path through a concise builder that returns `Object.fromEntries(zipHeadersWithValues(...))`. This satisfied the complexity rule while keeping the behavior intact.
