# JSDoc cleanup batch

- **Challenge:** The lint report surfaced hundreds of warnings across many files, making it difficult to isolate the JSDoc-related items I needed to tackle.
- **Resolution:** Redirected the lint output to a temporary file and used `rg`/`sed` to focus on the specific files and rules that required documentation updates. This kept the scope manageable while ensuring at least twenty warnings were cleared.
