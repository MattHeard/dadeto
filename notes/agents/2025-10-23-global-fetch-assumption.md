- **Task**: Update `src/cloud/generate-stats/index.js` to assume `globalThis.fetch` is always available.
- **Challenge**: Ensuring we still pass a bound fetch implementation while removing the previous conditional guard.
- **Resolution**: Replaced the ternary with a direct `globalThis.fetch.bind(globalThis)` assignment so the function is consistently provided without relying on optional chaining.
