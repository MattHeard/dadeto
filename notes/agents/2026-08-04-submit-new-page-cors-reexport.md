# Submit new page CORS re-export

- **Challenge:** Needed to reuse the shared CORS configuration within the `submit-new-page` module without continuing to rely on deep relative imports that bypass local entry points.
- **Resolution:** Added a local `cors-config.js` re-export in the feature directory and adjusted the handler to consume it, ensuring consistency with nearby modules.
