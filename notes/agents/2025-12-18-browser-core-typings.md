Felt the tsdoc swarm in `browser-core.js` was manageable once I reconciled the loose DOM helper typing.
- I hadn’t realised the existing helpers weren’t typed, so the tsdoc failures felt like a cascade of DOM references; the blocker turned out to be missing DOM helper typedefs, the `DisposableElement` guard, and the inline logger signatures.  Once I defined `DOMHelpers`, a reuseable `ContainerHandler`, and a helper for `_dispose`, the rest of the file compiled cleanly.
- While linting I hit the jsdoc warnings about missing descriptions and undefined DOM types; from the diagnostics I picked a lightweight `DOMEventListener` alias plus extra `@param`/@returns` blurbs so the warnings disappear without touching the logic.
- Keeping tsdoc in this repo will stay rough since the global check still fails outside `browser-core`, so future work should scope the compiler or tackle the other modules incrementally (maybe by isolating new tsconfigs).  No new open questions surfaced beyond that ongoing tsdoc debt.
- While the existing note mentioned `browser-core`, tightening the `data.js` docs and controller typedefs showed me that `BlogStateRecord` needs to keep both the index signature and the specific properties in sync or tsdoc will start treating every property as `unknown`; that is a good reminder for any future jog through the browser helpers.
