# Follow-up Adjustment: get-api-key-credit handler path

- Replaced the cloud-level re-export with `src/cloud/get-api-key-credit/handler.js` to match the function directory structure.
- Updated the function entrypoint to consume the new sibling module.
- No tests were run; only path adjustments were required.
