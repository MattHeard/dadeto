Tags DOM helpers

- Added explicit JSDoc typedefs and parameter annotations to `src/core/browser/tags.js` so every handler now exposes `HTMLElement`, `string`, and `Event` signatures, and the helper returns are typed rather than generic `Function`.
- Adjusted `handleTagLinks` to treat the anchor elements as `HTMLElement[]` before iterating and gave all returned event handlers a typed callback so `strictNullChecks`/`strictFunctionTypes` no longer see implicit any parameters.
- Re-ran `npm run tsdoc:check`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` to update the failure log (`tsdoc-check-output.txt` now still lists the expected strict failures in the cloud/story helpers), and kept the lint log at the existing battleship presenter warnings.

Next steps: continue addressing the next child bead in the strict-null epic (`dadeto-nmo` for cloud helpers or whichever area you prefer).
