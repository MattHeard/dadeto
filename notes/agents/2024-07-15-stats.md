# Agent Retrospective – 2024-07-15 (Generate stats)

- **Surprise:** `getTopStories` was still flagged for complexity even though it just forwarded to `loadTopStories`; the lint rule counts default parameters as branches, so the helper needed a restructure.
- **Action:** Pulled the default limit resolution into `resolveTopStoriesLimit`, letting `getTopStories` just pass through its resolved arguments while the helper now owns the conditional fallback to 5.
- **Lesson:** When ESLint keeps flagging thin helpers for complexity, consider extracting even the default-resolution guards into their own functions so the public API stays inside the limit.
