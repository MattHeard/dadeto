# Agent Note

- **Task**: Reduce lint complexity warning in `src/core/copy.js`.
- **Challenge**: Needed to lower cyclomatic complexity without triggering other lint rules like `no-ternary`.
- **Resolution**: Extracted a helper to isolate path selection logic and rewrote it using early returns to stay within complexity limits while satisfying `no-ternary`.
