## Summary

- Focused on adding missing `@returns` annotations in `src/cloud/render-variant/index.js`.

## Reflection

- **Surprise:** Running `npm run lint` surfaced hundreds of pre-existing warnings unrelated to the touched file. I initially
  worried the new annotations might have triggered additional noise, but checking the report confirmed that only the prior
  `no-ternary` warning for the module remained.
- **Lesson:** When lint output is noisy, filter for the modified file to verify the impact of the change. This saves time versus
  triaging unrelated warnings.

## Next Steps

- Consider scheduling a dedicated effort to tackle the backlog of lint warnings so targeted updates are easier to validate.
