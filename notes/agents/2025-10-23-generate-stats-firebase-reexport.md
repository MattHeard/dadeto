# Generate stats firebase re-export

- **Challenge:** Needed to confirm the expected re-export pattern for cloud functions to avoid diverging from established conventions.
- **Resolution:** Inspected existing `firebaseApp.js` re-export in `src/cloud/assign-moderation-job/` and replicated the same `export *` syntax for the generate-stats module.
