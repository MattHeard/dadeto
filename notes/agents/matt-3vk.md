## matt-3vk retrospective
- **Unexpected hurdle:** Achieving 100% branch coverage for the auto-submit listener helpers feels like a coverage configuration issue; Jest only reports branches for `src/core`, so I confirmed the unmeasured `src/browser/toys.js` branches by running the file-specific suite and asserting listener registration/removal guards explicitly.
- **Learning:** Covering `registerAutoSubmitListener`, `unregisterAutoSubmitListener`, and the auto-checkbox change handler through `initializeInteractiveComponent.autoSubmit.test.js` was enough to exercise the guard branches (duplicate registration, missing checkbox, early removal skip). The generator tests needed matching expectations for the new checkbox markup so the UI branch is touched whenever the toy UI is rendered.
- **Open follow-ups:** If the 100% branch mandate resurfaces for `src/browser` files, consider adding a dedicated coverage suite that runs `collectCoverageFrom=src/browser/**/*.js` so the tooling can confirm those modules independently of the core-focused report.
