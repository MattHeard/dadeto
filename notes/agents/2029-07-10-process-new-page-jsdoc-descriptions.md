# Process New Page JSDoc Descriptions (2029-07-10)

## Unexpected hurdles
- `npm run lint` still streams the full lint report to stdout, so confirming that the JSDoc warnings disappeared required waiting for the entire report (~300 legacy warnings) to print. I double-checked the targeted file afterwards to make sure the new descriptions landed correctly.

## What I learned / would do differently
- Before running the linter, it helps to open the existing comment block and plan the phrasing for each nested parameter. Writing the descriptions in one pass avoids repeat edits and keeps the diff clean.

## Follow-up questions
- Would it be acceptable to trim the lint report to only the touched files? That might make follow-up runs more actionable.
