# Coverage Improvements - 2025-05-19

- Added comprehensive tests for the get-moderation-variant core module to drive branch coverage to 100%.
- Faced numerous branching paths that required crafting Firestore/authentication stubs; resolved by building focused fixtures for each conditional path.
- Ensured headers handling covered lowercase, array, and malformed inputs to tick every branch.
