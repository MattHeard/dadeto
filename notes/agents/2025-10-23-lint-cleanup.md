# Lint Report Cleanup

- **Challenge:** Needed to confirm the tracked lint artifacts under `reports/lint/` were derived outputs safe to remove without affecting source code.
- **Resolution:** Cross-checked repository guidelines noting lint reports belong under `reports/` and removed the directory before adding it to `.gitignore` so future lint runs stay untracked.
