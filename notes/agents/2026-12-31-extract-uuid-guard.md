# Extract UUID Guard Refactor

- **Challenge:** Running the repo-standard lint script auto-applied fixes across unrelated files, obscuring the targeted lint warning we intended to address.
- **Resolution:** Restored the working tree to `HEAD` and re-applied only the guard-clause refactor in `src/core/cloud/get-api-key-credit-v2/core.js`, then reran ESLint on the core directory without `--fix` to verify the remaining warnings count.
