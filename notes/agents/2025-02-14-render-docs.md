# Render contents documentation adjustments

- **Surprise:** Running `npm run lint` streams a massive warning list; it took a while to confirm the specific file's warnings were gone because ESLint emits the full report via `cat reports/lint/lint.txt`. I had to scan for our file manually.
- **Diagnosis:** Waited for the report to finish and used the warnings list to verify that `src/cloud/render-contents/index.js` no longer raised JSDoc issues. This confirmed the `@returns` additions worked even though unrelated warnings still appear.
- **Future tip:** After edits that only touch one module, consider piping the lint report through `rg` (e.g., `rg "render-contents" reports/lint/lint.txt`) once the command finishes to quickly check for module-specific warnings instead of reading the whole list.
- **Open question:** Wonder if the project maintainers plan to lower the lint noise (lots of complexity warnings). A targeted lint script might speed up focused edits.
