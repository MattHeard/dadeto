# Lint Violation Fix

- **Challenge:** Lint flagged `traverseSegment` in `src/core/toys/2025-03-29/get.js` for excessive cyclomatic complexity.
- **Resolution:** Extracted creation of the non-object error result into `createNonObjectErrorResult` so `traverseSegment` no longer needs branching logic. Confirmed the warning disappeared by re-running `npm run lint`.
