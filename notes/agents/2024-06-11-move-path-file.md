# Agent Work Log

- **Task**: Move `src/node/path.js` into the build layer and update imports.
- **Challenge**: After moving the module, multiple entry points still referenced the old `../node/path.js` path.
- **Resolution**: Performed repository-wide searches to update the build and cloud scripts to import the relocated helper and reran Jest + ESLint to confirm everything was still green (acknowledging pre-existing lint warnings).
