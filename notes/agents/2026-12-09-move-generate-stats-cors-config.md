# Generate stats cors-config cleanup

## Challenges
- Needed to confirm no other modules relied on the local `cors-config.js` shim before removing it so the shared helper remained accessible.

## Resolutions
- Searched for imports of the shim, updated the generate stats entry point to pull `getAllowedOrigins` directly from the shared module, and deleted the redundant file.
