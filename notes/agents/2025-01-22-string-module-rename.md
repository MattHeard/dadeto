# String module rename

- Challenge: Ensuring that all references to `stringUtils.js` were updated after renaming the module to `str.js` without missing any call sites.
- Resolution: Used `rg` to locate import paths referencing the old filename, updated the affected test modules, and confirmed no remaining references remained.
