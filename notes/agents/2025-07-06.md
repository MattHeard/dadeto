# Extracted reputation query helper

- **Challenge:** Needed to move query composition from the GCF wrapper into the shared core without duplicating logic or breaking the existing Firestore query chain.
- **Resolution:** Added a core helper that composes `createVariantsQuery` and `createReputationScopedQuery`, then updated the Cloud Function wrapper to call the new helper so downstream ordering and filtering stayed unchanged.
