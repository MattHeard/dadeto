# Lint Warning Cleanup

- **Challenge:** ESLint reports hundreds of warnings in `src/core/`, making it hard to confirm individual fixes.
- **Resolution:** Focused on a single warning by documenting the random generator contract in `process-new-page-core.js`, then reran the linter to verify the warning count dropped.
