## Context
- Ran `npm run tcr` per request. The script chains `npm test` and `npm run lint` before auto-committing with the default `"refactor"` message.

## Surprise / Diagnosis
- Forgot the script auto-commits even when no custom message is passed, so it silently grabbed `refactor` and created a commit. Verified the history with `git log -1`.

## Guidance
- Always pass a descriptive message (`./tcr.sh "message"`) to avoid anonymous commits.
- Double-check `git status -sb` after the script completes to ensure it did not revert or commit unexpectedly.

## Follow-Ups
- None, but consider enhancing `tcr.sh` to require an explicit message to reduce accidental commits.
