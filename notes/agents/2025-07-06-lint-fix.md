# Lint Fix in core submit-new-page handler

- **Challenge:** Needed to remove ternary expressions flagged by the strict `no-ternary` rule without altering the request handling logic or increasing complexity.
- **Resolution:** Replaced the ternaries with small helper assignments and explicit counters so the control flow stays clear and the handler still enforces the single-option requirement.
