## Unexpected hurdle
Moving `LIST_ITEM_HTML` looked trivial, but the repo guidelines require running the full Jest suite whenever anything under `src/core/` changes. Easy to overlook when refactoring small helpers.

## Diagnosis
I reread `AGENTS.md` after editing `src/core/cloud/render-contents`, noticed the explicit testing rule, and confirmed we still need to run `npm test` even for pure refactors.

## Guidance
Any time you touch `src/core/**`, budget the extra minutes for `npm test` (it runs the whole suite with coverage). Queue it up immediately after saving your change so you are not tempted to skip the requirement.

## Follow-ups
- None beyond continuing to honor the `src/core/**` testing rule; if the suite runtime becomes painful we might explore a lighter smoke-test script, but today the full run was manageable.
