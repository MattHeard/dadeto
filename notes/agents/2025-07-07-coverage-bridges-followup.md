## Summary
- Clarified Jest coverage ignore patterns with comments calling out the cloud and toy bridge shims.
- Verified the toy objectUtils/validation proxies are pure re-exports so excluding them keeps coverage semantics intact.
- Reconfirmed the broader coverage goals after the reviewer question about which files qualify as bridges.
