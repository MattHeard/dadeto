# Agent Work Summary

- Ensured test suite ran with coverage to confirm 100% branch coverage for `src/core/`.
- Re-ran ESLint to inspect warnings and focused on reducing complexity warnings within core modules.
- Simplified the `readUuid` helper to remove an unnecessary guard so it now passes the strict complexity threshold without altering behavior.

## Challenges

- The repository enforces an unusually low cyclomatic complexity threshold (2), which made it tricky to adjust functions without triggering new warnings.
- Running the lint command with `--fix` introduced unrelated formatting/JSDoc changes that needed to be reverted to keep the diff focused.

## Follow-ups

- Many remaining lint warnings stem from the aggressive complexity rule; resolving them will likely require broader refactors that split existing functions into smaller units.
