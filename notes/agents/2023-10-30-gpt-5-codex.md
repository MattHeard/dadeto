# Refining resolveIncomingOptionContext

- **Surprise:** The initial eslint JSON run kept hanging because I redirected output to `/tmp/eslint.json` without realising the command needed a couple of minutes to churn through hundreds of warnings. I assumed it stalled and interrupted it, leaving me with an empty file. Waiting it out (and rerunning after the refactor) produced the data I needed. In hindsight, I should have checked the process list before cancelling.
- **Debugging the refactor:** Splitting `resolveIncomingOptionContext` surfaced a bunch of stray JSDoc warnings. The automatic patch tools wrapped identifiers like `params.findAvailablePageNumberFn`, so eslint flagged bogus `jsdoc/valid-types` errors. I ended up replacing the doc blocks via a small Python script and reformatting the comments manually. Next time I’ll rely on scripted replacements earlier instead of iterative patch attempts.
- **Takeaway:** When working in this repo, budget time for eslint runs—they’re noisy but authoritative for complexity counts. If you refactor long functions, update the accompanying JSDoc immediately and re-run eslint with `-f json` so you can quantify the improvement before committing.
