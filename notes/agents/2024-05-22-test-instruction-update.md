# Test Instruction Update

- **Task**: Added guidance in `AGENTS.md` requiring unit tests when `src/core/` changes occur.
- **Challenge**: Ensuring the new directive fit naturally within the existing testing guidelines without redundancy.
- **Resolution**: Placed the note alongside other testing requirements and matched the established tone to keep the section cohesive.
