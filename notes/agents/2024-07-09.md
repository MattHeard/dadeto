# Agent Retrospective – 2024-07-09

- **Surprise:** The repo already runs ESLint with a strict complexity limit and reports dozens of warnings, so I spent extra time understanding the existing `createCredentialFactory` obligations before editing.
- **Action:** Pulled the credential-validation branch into its own helper functions so the exported factory now just delegates to `ensureGoogleAuthProvider` and `validateCredentialFactory`, which keeps each function within the complexity threshold.
- **Lesson:** When targeting complexity warnings, try to split responsibilities instead of piling multiple checks into single helpers; smaller helpers are easier to test and keep lint passing.
- **Follow-up idea:** Consider documenting other remaining complexity warnings (e.g., in `assign-moderation-job-core.js`) so future agents can pick the next candidate quickly.
