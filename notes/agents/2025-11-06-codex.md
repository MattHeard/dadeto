## Unexpected hurdles
- Jest crashed under TCR because the sandbox blocks Watchman. The default `npm test` script hits the watcher handshake and exits early. Adding `--watchman=false` to the test script kept coverage consistent while avoiding the crash.
- `git add` during TCR failed with `Operation not permitted` on `.git/index.lock`; the git write is blocked in this environment. TCR still ran the checks but the commit step was a no-op. Worth flagging for future agents so they do not trust the "Changes committed" log line.

## Guidance for next time
- Prefer running `npm test -- --watchman=false` (or rely on the updated `npm test` script) before using other automation—any flow that shells out to Jest inherits the issue.
- After running `./tcr.sh`, verify `git status` manually. If changes remain unstaged, the script could not lock the index; plan to commit manually once permissions allow.

## Open questions
- Is there a sandbox-friendly alternative for commits so TCR can finish cleanly, or should we wrap the git steps with permission checks?
