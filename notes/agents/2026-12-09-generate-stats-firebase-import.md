## Summary

Updated the generate-stats Cloud Function to import `ensureFirebaseApp` directly from the shared module. The prior re-export file made it unclear which implementation was being used.

## Challenges

* Needed to confirm there were no nested `AGENTS.md` files imposing additional constraints on the generate-stats directory before removing the redundant re-export module.

## Resolution

* Searched for scoped agent instructions and validated only the repository-level guidelines applied.
* Pointed the index module to the shared Firebase initializer and removed the unused re-export file.
