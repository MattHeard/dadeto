Tried to chip away at the spike of complexity warnings coming out of `src/core/cloud/render-contents/render-contents-core.js`. The helper graph kept pushing more warnings back (complexity, max params) every time I split logic, so I had to balance fewer nested branches against the new helpers that also needed docs. The big win was cleaning up docs and reorganizing the invalidation helpers and auth flow, which reduced the total `src/core` warnings from 130 down to 115, but the remaining calls still fail the strict complexity cap because they combine optional chaining with multi-branch guards. Next time I would explore moving some of that logic into dedicated modules so the `complexity` rule can be tuned per helper, or build smaller wrappers that the rule already accepts before adding more helper functions. Open question: should we relax the per-file complexity threshold in ESLint when a function has to stitch together so many guard paths?
