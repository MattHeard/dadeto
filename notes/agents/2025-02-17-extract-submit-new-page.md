# Submit new page handler refactor

## What surprised me
- ESLint's complexity rule triggered new warnings for each helper I extracted, which I didn't anticipate. I expected the rule to celebrate lower complexity, but it flagged the helpers themselves because the threshold is fixed at 2.
- The repository enforces JSDoc on every function, so the new helpers immediately produced `jsdoc/require-*` warnings. That requirement wasn't obvious until I re-ran `npm run lint`.

## How I worked through it
- After spotting the complexity and documentation warnings in `reports/lint/lint.txt`, I reran lint locally to inspect the new messages. That made it clear which helpers needed additional metadata.
- I added full JSDoc blocks for each helper and reworded the top-level comment so it better described the supporting utilities. Python snippets were faster than `apply_patch` for replacing the partially generated comment text.

## Takeaways for the next agent
- Whenever you introduce helper functions under `src/core/cloud`, budget time to add full JSDoc annotationsâ€”lint enforces them even for internal utilities.
- The complexity rule is extremely strict (max 2), so expect warnings to remain even after refactors. Use extraction to lower the worst offenders, but don't chase the long tail unless the task explicitly requires it.
- If `apply_patch` struggles with long comment blocks, reach for a short Python script to rewrite the section; it avoids fiddly escaping and ensures consistent replacements.

## Open questions
- Should we consider adjusting the ESLint configuration so complexity limits match practical expectations for backend code? That might reduce the noise when making incremental improvements like this.
