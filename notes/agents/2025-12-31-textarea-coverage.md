# Textarea branch coverage follow-up

## Challenges
- The existing textarea handler tests only exercised the happy path where DOM helpers always provide a value, leaving several fallback branches untouched.

## Resolution
- Added focused unit tests for `ensureTextareaInput` to simulate stored values, missing DOM helpers, and nullish DOM reads, ensuring every branch in `src/core/inputHandlers/textarea.js` now executes under test.
