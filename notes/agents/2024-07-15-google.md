# Agent Retrospective – 2024-07-15 (Admin core Google helper)

- **Surprise:** `win?.google?.accounts` still counted as branching, so ESLint kept warning about complexity even after extracting the accounts lookup.
- **Action:** Added `getGoogleObj` to pull the `google` namespace from the `Window` and had `getGoogleAccountsCandidate` build on it, isolating each optional access into its own helper.
- **Lesson:** When chained optional accesses trigger complexity warnings, pull each segment into a dedicated helper; it keeps the primary utilities readable and lets lint evaluate a simpler call graph.
