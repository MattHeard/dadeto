# Tag DOM helpers typing

- **Unexpected hurdle:** `npm run tsdoc:check` still fails because the presenter/toy/cloud helpers listed in `tsdoc-check-output.txt` weren’t fixed by this change, so the script aborts at the same backlog even after typing `tags.js`.
- **Work:** Introduced `TagsDOMHelpers` (extending the shared `DOMHelpers` contract plus the local `createHideSpan`) and annotated each exported helper so the compiler now understands all DOM dependencies. Re-ran `npm run tsdoc:check` (log captured in `tsdoc-check-output.txt`) and `npm test` to confirm the runtime suite still passes.
- **Next steps:** The tsdoc backlog still points at presenters/toys/cloud helpers (`dadeto-ycn`, `dadeto-ho5`, and others), so the next agent can knock them out before rerunning `npm run tsdoc:check` to reduce the remaining errors.
