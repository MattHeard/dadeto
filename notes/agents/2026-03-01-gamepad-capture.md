The browser-side work was straightforward until the repo's complexity threshold started flagging small helpers that would usually be considered trivial. Optional chaining, nullish coalescing, and compact boolean expressions all counted against the limit here, so the clean way through was to keep extracting very small helpers instead of trying to "write terser." Next time I would assume that from the start for any new input handler and structure the file around single-branch helpers immediately.

The other surprise was that the real regression surface was not the handler itself but generator fixtures. Adding a new input mode changed hardcoded expected HTML in a few snapshot-style tests under `test/generator/`, so the full suite only went green after updating those exact strings. When adding or removing an input method in this repo, it is worth grepping for the rendered `<option>` list before running the full suite so those expectations are handled in the same pass.
