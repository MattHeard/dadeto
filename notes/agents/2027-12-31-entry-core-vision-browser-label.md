## Entry/Core vision naming alignment follow-up
- **Context:** Needed to address a lingering `browserEnv` reference in the architecture note after the last rename pass.
- **Challenge:** Ensuring every textual mention, including narrative sections, consistently uses the canonical `browser` label without altering surrounding guidance.
- **Outcome:** Updated the relevant bullet points in `notes/entry-core-dependency-vision.md` and re-read the section to confirm no other stale names remain.
