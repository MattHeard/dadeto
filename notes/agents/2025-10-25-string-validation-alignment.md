# String validation alignment

## Challenges
- Ensuring that the delegation from `stringUtils.isValidText` to `validation.isValidString` did not introduce circular imports or violate ES module ordering rules.

## Resolutions
- Verified there are no existing imports from `validation.js` back into `stringUtils.js`, then moved the new import to the top of the file to keep module syntax valid.
