# Generate stats env refactor follow-up testing

## Challenges
- Reviewer requested verification that the generate stats refactor still passes the Jest suite after switching the core factory to accept `process.env`. Running the full suite can take several minutes and requires enabling experimental VM modules for Jest.

## Resolutions
- Executed `npm test` locally to run all 386 Jest suites with coverage, confirming the generate stats helpers still satisfy the expectations.
