- **Surprise**: While digging into the warning for `postTriggerRenderContents`, the guard clauses made `npm test` rely on custom error messages. When the user asked for the guard removal the tests still passed because the subsequent `await getAdminEndpointsFn()` rejects immediately when `null` is provided, so no functional gap appeared.
- **Diagnosis**: The helper is only invoked by `executeTriggerRender`, which supplies `createGetAdminEndpointsFromStaticConfig`, so runtime never passes falsy values; the guard clauses therefore just duplicated behavior. Tests now assert the existence of a `TypeError` rather than the specific message. That keeps coverage at 100% without spinning up additional fixtures.
- **Next steps**: Keep an eye on ESLint complexity; if the warning resurfaces we may want to refactor `postTriggerRenderContents` to spin off a smaller helper so it stays under the limit while still handling the happy path cleanly.
