# Process new page JSDoc cleanup

- The lint run surfaced dozens of `jsdoc/require-*` warnings in `src/core/cloud/process-new-page/process-new-page-core.js` because most helpers only had placeholder block comments.
- Added explicit param/return descriptions with Firestore types while keeping the runtime logic untouched.
- Verified the updated documentation still passes the lint workflow and counted the remaining warnings under `src/core/` for reporting.
