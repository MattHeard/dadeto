## Summary
- Needed to deduplicate string validators in the get-api-key-credit core handler by delegating to the shared validation helper.

## Challenges
- Sorting through multiple helper modules in `src/core` to confirm that `isValidString` exactly matched the bespoke `isNonEmptyString` logic without altering behavior.

## Outcome
- Verified equivalence (both enforce string type and non-empty content) and updated the handler to import the shared helper instead of maintaining duplicate logic.
