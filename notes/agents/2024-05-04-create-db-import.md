## Task
Align the `get-api-key-credit-v2` Cloud Function entry point with the core module exports.

## Challenge
The index module imported `createDb` from a local shim even though the core module already re-exported the factory. Ensuring consistency required verifying the shared core exports before updating the import path.

## Resolution
Confirmed `src/core/cloud/get-api-key-credit-v2/core.js` re-exports `createDb` and updated the Cloud Function entry to rely on that central module, keeping both the import and re-export consistent.
