# Agent Reflection - Retrospective Guidelines (2025-10-29)

- **Unexpected challenge**: The existing `AGENTS.md` already instructed agents to log notes, so it was easy to gloss over why the new feedback mattered. I needed to reread several recent retrospectives to understand the gapâ€”most simply restated tasks instead of surfacing surprises or learnings.
- **What helped**: Comparing multiple agent notes made the pattern clear and informed the revised guidance. I rewrote the policy to emphasize unexpected hurdles, lessons learned, and actionable advice rather than status summaries.
- **Takeaway for future agents**: When updating shared guidelines, validate the lived behavior (check past notes) before editing. That baseline helps tailor instructions so they nudge the team toward the desired outcome.
