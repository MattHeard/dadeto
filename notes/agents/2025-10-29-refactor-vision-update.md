# Refactor Vision Review (2025-10-29)

- **Challenge**: Verifying whether the refactor milestones were already complete required tracing current asset locations and CI workflows without disturbing generated output.
- **Resolution**: Inspected the `src/` and `public/` directory trees, reviewed `package.json`, and read the Netlify/GCP workflow definitions to document completed steps and highlight remaining work in `notes/refactor-vision.md`.
