Chasing 100% coverage uncovered that pure re-export modules (and a typedef-only module) still showed 0% in the report even after importing them. The only reliable fix was to add tiny marker exports and assert them in tests so Istanbul had executable statements to count. If this comes up again, scan for single-line re-export files in the coverage table and either mark them for exclusion or add explicit markers to avoid wasting time on imports that won't move coverage.
