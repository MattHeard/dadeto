# Agent Worklog - 2025-05-28

## Challenges
- Needed to decouple the CLI generate script from filesystem and Prettier specifics for unit testing.
- Ensuring Jest ESM tests had access to mocking utilities required explicitly importing `jest` from `@jest/globals`.

## Resolutions
- Introduced a dependency-injected factory in `createWriteFormattedHtml` so tests can provide stubs while production code wires real implementations.
- Added the necessary Jest import to the new test suite to enable mock creation under the ESM configuration.
