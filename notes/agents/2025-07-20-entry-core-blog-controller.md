# Entry/core blog data controller refactor

- **Challenge:** Needed a more substantial bridge between the browser entry and core blog data loader to satisfy the dependency-injection vision without regressing existing behaviors.
- **Resolution:** Introduced a memoized `createBlogDataController` factory that validates and captures the injected dependencies, updated the browser entry point to use the controller-bound helpers, and expanded unit tests to cover the new factory workflow.
