# Refactoring announceTriggerRenderResult

## Surprise
Running the fixer-heavy lint script froze for a while because it streams the entire lint report through `cat`. I initially thought the command hung or the output path was wrong. After waiting it finally flushed, but every subsequent run required a long pause.

## Diagnosis
I checked whether `reports/lint` existed and inspected another shell to see if the report file was being written. Once I let the command finish, the gigantic lint report appeared, revealing that `announceTriggerRenderResult` carried the highest complexity warning (11).

## What Helped
Extracting the failure-reporting code into `reportTriggerRenderFailure` lowered the complexity of the original function to 3. ESLint's auto-generated JSDoc stubs can appear after running `--fix`, so I immediately revisit the surrounding lines to restore meaningful comments.

## Next Time
When working with this repo's lint script, queue up a second shell so you can monitor files or tail the report instead of assuming the command crashed. Also, expect new helper functions to trigger complexity warningsâ€”plan to keep them simple or break them down early.

## Open Questions
It might be worth scripting a filtered lint run (e.g., `npx eslint src/core/browser/admin/core.js --max-warnings=0 --format=compact`) so agents can iterate faster without printing the entire report each time. Unsure whether maintainers would accept such a helper.
