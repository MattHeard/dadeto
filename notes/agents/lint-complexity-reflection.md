# Lint Complexity Reflection

- **Unexpected hurdle:** ESLint’s `complexity` rule treated inline boolean chains (`&&`, `??`, etc.) as separate branches, so my first attempt to simplify `isDuplicateAppError` and similar helpers actually kept the warning alive. I diagnosed it by rerunning lint and watching the same functions reported even though the code looked simpler.
- **Approach:** I wound back to splitting the checks into multiple tiny helpers, each with at most one conditional. That required adding documentation and `sendGenerateFailure` helpers to avoid the `||` branch, which added churn but satisfied the rule without disabling it.
- **Lesson:** When wrestling with aggressive complexity limits, prefer narrowing each function to a single decision point instead of relying on `&&`/`||` expressions; expect to add descriptive helpers and JSDoc notes as you break apart logic.
- **Follow-up:** Keep an eye on other files that hit these rules—there are still >90 warnings overall—and consider whether the team wants to loosen `complexity` thresholds or provide more helper utilities to keep cognitive load manageable.
- **Additional reflection:** While trimming warnings I also had to switch the Google auth helpers to object-based injections, update their consumer tests, and fix the render-contents invalidation helpers (bringing along an `isNonEmptyString` helper) so the suite continued to pass.
