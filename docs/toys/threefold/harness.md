# THREEFOLD Harness

## Local Run Instructions

1. Install prerequisites: `npm install`.
2. Build the standalone page and copied game modules: `npm run build`.
3. Serve the generated static site with `npm run start`, then open `/threefold/`.
4. Run the focused runtime suite with `node --experimental-vm-modules ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --runInBand --runTestsByPath test/core/browser/game/threefold-runtime.test.js --no-watchman`.

## Expected Observable Outputs

- The page shows a Mosslight-style handheld frame labelled 160 × 144.
- The opening view reports scale 0, Anchor 8, and the rising crisis stage.
- Arrows move, A grows, B shrinks, X waits 15 in-game minutes, and Y saves.
- The west wall remains damaged after reload when Mara grows through it.
- The focused Jest suite passes and exits with status 0.
- Build artifacts are written under `public/`; full check evidence is written under `.tmp/` and coverage reports under `reports/coverage/`.

## Troubleshooting Hooks

- Verbose mode command: `npm run check`.
- Log location: `.tmp/threefold-check.log` for an explicitly logged local run.
- Cleanup command: remove only the task-specific `.tmp/threefold-*` files after retaining needed evidence.
- If the canvas is blank, verify that `/threefold/game.js` and `/core/browser/game/threefold/page.js` were copied into `public/`.
