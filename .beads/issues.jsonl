{"id":"dadeto-ycn","title":"Document presenter DOM helpers","description":"The first batch of tsdoc failures now falls inside the presenter helpers:\n\n- `src/core/browser/presenters/battleshipSolitaireClues.js` reports dozens of missing properties/implicit anys (`rowClues`, `colClues`, `Array\u003cT\u003e` generics, unnamed parameter types).\n- `src/core/browser/presenters/ticTacToeBoard.js` and `src/core/browser/tags.js` also show `tsc` treating DOM helpers as plain `object` and reporting implicit `any` parameters (e.g., `position`, `player`, `event`).\n\nWe need to declare shared DOM helper typedefs (`DOMHelpers`, `TextHelpers`, etc.) and annotate each exported helper so the compiler knows the exact properties and removes the `unknown`/`object` errors. In particular, the presenter functions should accept typed `options` with `rowClues`, `colClues`, and the DOM `container` helper should list `createElement`/`setTextContent`/`addEventListener` so uses of those properties stop being flagged.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n* Each presenter helper has a documented parameter shape (e.g., `@typedef {object} BattleshipCluePayload`) that lists the needed arrays/fields.\n* The DOM helper objects passed into the presenters expose explicit members instead of being inferred as `object`.\n* The `tsdoc:check` run that currently produces these errors no longer reports them (the rest of the log can still fail elsewhere).\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"chore","created_at":"2026-01-02T11:14:40.118474+01:00","created_by":"matthew.heard","updated_at":"2026-01-02T12:15:25.587574+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-02T12:15:25.587574+01:00","close_reason":"Resolved","comments":[{"id":3,"issue_id":"dadeto-ycn","author":"matthew.heard","text":"Documented the presenter payload shapes and DOM helpers, reran \n\u003e blog-generator@1.0.0 tsdoc:check\n\u003e tsc --project tsconfig.jsdoc.json\n\nsrc/core/browser/storageLens.js(46,27): error TS2345: Argument of type 'string | TValue' is not assignable to parameter of type 'TValue'.\n  'TValue' could be instantiated with an arbitrary type which could be unrelated to 'string | TValue'.\nsrc/core/browser/tags.js(35,51): error TS7006: Parameter 'className' implicitly has an 'any' type.\nsrc/core/browser/tags.js(39,43): error TS2345: Argument of type '{ createHideSpan: Function;
