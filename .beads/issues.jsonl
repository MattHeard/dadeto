In particular, the presenter functions should accept typed `options` with `rowClues`, `colClues`, and the DOM `container` helper should list `createElement`/`setTextContent`/`addEventListener` so uses of those properties stop being flagged.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n* Each presenter helper has a documented parameter shape (e.g., `@typedef {object} BattleshipCluePayload`) that lists the needed arrays/fields.\n* The DOM helper objects passed into the presenters expose explicit members instead of being inferred as `object`.\n* The `tsdoc:check` run that currently produces these errors no longer reports them (the rest of the log can still fail elsewhere).\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"chore","created_at":"2026-01-02T11:14:40.118474+01:00","created_by":"matthew.heard","updated_at":"2026-01-02T12:15:25.587574+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-02T12:15:25.587574+01:00","close_reason":"Resolved"}
