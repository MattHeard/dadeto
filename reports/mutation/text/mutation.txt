You probably configured a test environment in jest that is not reporting code coverage to Stryker. 
See also https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html#testenvironment-string

Are you using node, jsdom or jsdom-sixteen as a test environment? Please change that:
  * node -> @stryker-mutator/jest-runner/jest-env/node
  * jsdom -> @stryker-mutator/jest-runner/jest-env/jsdom
  * jest-environment-jsdom-sixteen -> @stryker-mutator/jest-runner/jest-env/jsdom-sixteen

If you're using your own custom test environment, please enrich the environment with this mixin: 

const { mixinJestEnvironment} = require('@stryker-mutator/jest-runner');
module.exports = mixinJestEnvironment(MyCustomTestEnvironment);
