description: Step-by-step process to fix all lint warnings in the codebase
---

1. Run the TCR (Test && Commit || Revert) process to ensure the codebase is currently passing all tests and is in a clean state.
   - Command: `npm run tcr`
   - Wait up to 60 seconds for the TCR process to finish before checking the result, to ensure all tests and commits are completed.

2. Run the linter to generate the latest lint report.
   - Command: `npm run lint`

3. Examine the lint report and identify the first warning (topmost in the output).

4. Fix the code to resolve this first lint warning.
   - Make only the minimal change required to address the warning.
   - If the warning is related to cyclomatic complexity or complex conditional logic, consider following the dedicated workflow: `extract-conditional-logic` (see `.windsurf/workflows/extract-conditional-logic.md`).
   - If the warning is related to too many parameters (`max-params`) or parameter grouping, consider following the dedicated workflow: `group-related-params` (see `.windsurf/workflows/group-related-params.md`).
   - If the warning suggests that a for loop could be replaced by an iterator method (such as `.map`, `.reduce`, `.find`, etc.), follow the workflow: `convert-for-to-iterator` (see `.windsurf/workflows/convert-for-to-iterator.md`).

4. Repeat steps 1â€“3:
   - After fixing each warning, run TCR again.
   - Always address only the next warning in the report.
   - Continue until the lint report is clear (no warnings remain).

5. If at any point a test fails or the TCR process does not pass, revert or fix the code before proceeding to the next lint warning.

- This workflow should be run iteratively and automatically: after each fix, immediately proceed to the next lint warning and repeat the process, without waiting for user confirmation between steps.
