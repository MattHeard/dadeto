                    There's a funny scene in John Wick 4 where Wick is climbing a staircase, only to have to fight his way up against assailants. He gets kicked all the way back down, and has to repeat the ascent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As he climbed those stairs, the music rang familiar. Listening closely, I realized it was a remix, but this was Justice! Justice is one of my favorite French electronic bands, and it made perfect sense since the scene was set in Paris.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pulsing music of Justice is in line with the film's electronic vibe, and I was just totally loving it.

                    Look closer. The right side of South America once snuggled into the left side of Africa. For hundreds of years, since the development of good global maps, we suspected it but didn't <i>know</i> it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A century ago, geologists too were in a process of upheaval. In 1915, Alfred Weneger outlined this theory in <i>The Origins of Continents and Oceans</i>. But Weneger had more than a map: he had fossils.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Mesosaurus</i> was too little of a croc to swim across oceans, but lived on both sides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And <i>Glossopteris</i> was a seed fern whose seeds were too fat to blow so far.

                    I'm tired. It's not so bad. Others have it worse. But I'm tired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last year was quite a year, but my close friends and family didn't get COVID-19. My relationships have strengthened despite the stress. Worrying about elderly neighbours and isolating with bored children didn't wear me down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it wore me out.

                <p>
                    Every day is on autopilot with dozens of easy 5-minute tasks left undone for days. A brain fog smothers me from morning til night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The thing about walking through a fog is that you don't know where it ends. How much further do we have to go?

                    Free will has a problem. Either one chooses for a reason or for no reason. Either it's not a choice but an effect or it's not a choice but a dice roll. Either way, it's hard to blame someone like that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>The Sixth Extinction</i> surveys human irruption and decimation of other species. It doesn't lay blame. At a species level, the course of human history seems to be a mix of mere causality and being lucky. There's no call-to-action at the end of the book, because it's not clear there is an action anyone can take to reverse human nature.

                    Climate change is likely to cause hundreds of millions of extra people to die this century. Billions more will suffer. It cannot be “stopped”. In the face of this, grief is reasonable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But preventing climate change is not binary: not only success or only failure. It is a matter of degree. With every degree increased, millions more suffer. 6° is worse than 5° and 4°.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In turn, 4° is better than 5° and 6°. With every degree averted, millions more avoid suffering. So, even small actions have tremendous impacts. Choosing to avoid meat, or cycle, or catch a train helps.

                    Modularisation in software design is about breaking down simple collections of complicated components into complex collections of simple components. A complicated component acts incorrectly when you cannot understand its internal behavior. A complex collection acts unexpectedly when you cannot understand their external interactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All non-trivial software is both complicated and complex, and we can refactor to trade-off between complicated and complex designs. Object-oriented programmers explored these trade-offs for the last few decades and now microservice architects are exploring them too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since working with a few microservice designs, I'm starting to see some trade-offs, especially with tracing interactions and serialisation overhead.

                    I missed the deadline to register to vote in Germany for the European Union elections. I am very proud of having voted in every national and local election I could, until now. I’m not proud of every vote, but proud that I voted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have lots of excuses for missing the registration deadline:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brexit</li>
                    <li>Taking a working holiday in New Zealand</li>
                    <li>The deadline being on a Sunday</li>
                    <li>Not having a printer for my form</li>
                </ul>
                <p>But they’re all bad excuses.</p>
                <p>
                    I knew that I could have been eligible, and should have sorted out my registration well in advance. I’m ashamed now.
