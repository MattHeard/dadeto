There are architectural and software design decisions that are one-way doors, and vibe coding is incredibly dangerous when built with these patterns. The challenge for human developers is to detect the one-way doors and vibe code without them. Using automated verification, coding agents can run very fast and go back through the two-way doors when needed. Guardrails can also be built with these patterns, allowing the whole pipeline to run at top speed."

She gains an ability to recognise red, mirroring an ability others already possessed; she did not learn something about those people. Calling this \"know-how\" knowledge overextends the word \"know\". This echoes the \"ability hypothesis\" counter-argument by David Lewis and Laurence Nemirow. Because Mary gains a new ability through this experience that is reducible to physical explanation, no new non-physical fact like qualia is required. While intuitive, Jackson's \"knowledge argument\" about Mary's room fails to achieve its goal of disproving physicalism."

You do not receive rewards and punishments due to your \"moral responsibility\". You receive them due to your (mis)alignment with the community. But this alignment goes both ways.

This is Kierkegaard's example of \"teleological suspension of the ethical\". Here, the duty to obey God supersedes moral duty. I'm interested in coherent moral codes, which allow for determinate decision-making. I would frame this obedience to God as a \"trumping\" duty within a pluralistic moral framework. Reasoning drives quotidian decisions but a command from God would override that all. Kierkegaard appears to object to fitting this sublime duty of obedience into morality. Seems odd."

Others would refuse to divert the trolley, possibly because harm caused is worse than harm allowed. The lack of consensus can teach us about moral pluralism.

Permitted actions are those which one may or may not do. When searching for a moral code to guide their lives, people look for a system of principles, justifications, and directions for how to act. This makes restrictive religious standards popular and powerful. Alternatively, if a moral code primarily consists of only permitted actions, people can't use the moral code to make decisive choices because they are given too much wiggle room."

The cynic in me entertains the possibility that the Syrian passport found by one killer's body was a prop to brew distrust of all Syrian refugees. It is unknown whether it belonged to the killer. All of the other suspects or identified killers appear to be Belgian or French. To retaliate against refugees who are fleeing these killers would compound the tragedy.

The filmmakers clearly thought that the new film also needed something extra to keep their audiences interested."

        "Immersive virtual reality experiences may be only years, if not months, away. Despite enthusiasts' suspicion and hostility to the announcement, Facebook's acquisition of Oculus gives it a prime position for hosting the Street-like public hub. However, the majority of social interactions will be in private rooms like the Black Sun and Hiro Protagonist's office in _Snow Crash_. A federated social network could allow a heavy user to self-host and a casual user to connect through Facebook and both share the same virtual space. Rooms could establish realism standards and exclude avatars which break the immersion, encouraging investment in new designs."

        "If World War III ended with a few scrappy scavengers in a desolate, nuclear wasteland, I can imagine several technologies being easy to rebuild. A wheel is simple and could be crudely constructed by anyone. With some engineering experience, you could likely find the scraps and basic tools needed to build something like a water pump. But could even the greatest engineer in electronics rebuild or repair a CPU? Blunt tools would be insufficient for the nano-scale precision required. Some materials, such as rare earth metals, might be impossible to find. Some technology production clearly relies on multibillion dollar infrastructure."

While I can see _Gone Girl_ as a favourite of MRAs and red-pillers, I see it as a film advancing feminism too. _Gone Girl_ presents a strong female villain which almost never exists. If actresses need better roles to prove they are as talented as men, better roles need to be written. No matter how you feel about the character, it is clear that _Gone Girl_'s Amy is such a role."

The cyclist stopped to let me cross, and then pedalled hard to regain his lost momentum after I was across. This isn't very sensible. Cyclists have a much harder time decelerating and accelerating than pedestrians and drivers. Pedestrians should give way to cyclists so that they can maintain their momentum and use rolling stops instead of actual stops. It's arguably safer, too. Accidents might happen if a pedestrian assumes cyclists can stop quickly."

Deontologists blame the aggressor entirely: the victim had a right to not be harmed. Consequentialists might argue that the student knew the risks and is partially responsible for the consequences of their choice. This is uncomfortable logic. In response we can either (1) reject consequentialism, (2) accept that we should blame victims (at least privately), or (3) refine the consequentialist calculus to stop victim-blaming. Maybe we could argue that optimal consequences require systems of rights?"

The livestock industry produces somewhere between 18% and 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions and eating less meat and dairy is the easiest way to reduce the pollution you cause. Pure veganism, though, can be a chore when you are pelted with advertising for beef and milk. Applying the Pareto principle, 80% of the reduction could probably be done for 20% of the effort, and vice versa. Convince others that 80% veganism is easy and more emissions will be reduced than trying and failing to convince people to go straight to 100%."

I think the financial arguments being put forth are very convincing: fossil fuel companies likely have a lot of reserves which are going to be stranded as people take climate change more seriously and investment funds which have a long-term focus should be calculating this into their investment strategies. But if the purpose is to starve fossil fuel companies of investment, can it ever succeed? Part of my scepticism comes from a worry that other investors will happily buy the divested shares because their price-to-earnings ratio is slightly lower."

Labelling an organisation \"Princeton Men and Women Opposed to Proposition 174\" encouraged more advocacy for other genders than \"Princeton Opponents of Proposition 174\". _Feminism_ is a label used to describe advocacy for women's rights. But it also extends to the promotion of gender equality for everyone. Is the label \"feminist\" exclusive?"

        "I was sitting by a pool in a sunny resort in Fiji. Next to me there was a piña colada with condensation beading on the glass. And I couldn't put down _The Grapes of Wrath_ by John Steinbeck. The pain and poverty of its heroes was jarring against the luxurious, tropical backdrop. After adjusting for inflation, someone in 1937 would need to have picked over half a US ton of peaches to pay for the piña colada I had. Nonetheless, the novel has unrelenting optimism about perserverence through hardship. Meanwhile, Benjamin Graham made 14.7% per annum during the Great Depression."

Instead, we rely on experts and we trust their judgment about their topics of study. Suppose that you cannot trust experts; they might be colluding to mislead you.

        "Yashar Ali wrote a good summary of how dismissing women's negative reactions to sexism can make women feel like they are being irrational. There is an unfair stereotype that women are crazy, so if a woman responds to sexism in a negative way, she must be 'overreacting'. Saying \"you're so sensitive!\" undermines her perspective. Some people see this rejection of women's opinions as inconsiderate, most don't notice it at all. But it fuels a cruel stereotype by muting women's viewpoints, as it seeds self-doubt and self-censoring. If this causes women to be hesitant to speak up, communities lose valuable voices."

My wife and I have been sorting our books by spine colour for a while now, but it's not as impressive as his. I have been curious about 'objective' algorithms for sorting by spine colour because some multi-colour books, like Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Antifragile, just refuse to be cleanly categorised. What about fitting spine rectangles into a 2-dimensional bookcase rectangle, optimising for minimal distance between similarly coloured pixels?"

But on the other side, the film is shamelessly indulging in the very fetishes it criticises. The sucker punch is thrown at the audience, drawing them in to see a video game fantasy, and then reprimanding them by breaking their toys."

While Arctic sea ice levels alone do not establish human attribution, they identify much-needed climatic research. Second, the distinction between single- and multi-year ice highlights feedback loops. As more ice thaws and refreezes, less remains thick enough to maintain the albedo needed to prevent extra absorption of sunlight, accelerating warming."

I just finished my second book: _Introducing Political Philosophy_. I was cheating, though, because it is short and each page has a large picture. But it's interesting and seems to be a good summary of the history of political thought. My next is _Brave New World_ by Aldous Huxley."

For the few days before viewing it, I received the notion that the play in general, and also this Circa presentation of it were brilliant. I heard nothing but criticism for both, and so my expectations ran rampant and free.",
        "I criticise the play in general for trying so hard to be depressing, and although it succeeded at achieving this, it seems like a cheap attraction for audiences. We go to horror films to watch people in situations we wouldn't enjoy being in ourselves - watch _Saw_ or its sequel. (I haven't watched _Saw_ but from the impression I get from others who have watched it, it's addictive in a disturbing way.) I believe that people watch depressing films and plays to cheer themselves up, and I disagree with how a lot of people believe that making a film or play depressing makes it a better film or play.",
        "The play presents the idea of the \"American Dream\" and how it fails to transfer from an idealistic perspective of the social and economic world to a realistic perspective. The main fault of the idea is that although everyone may be capable of achieving success and reaching the top of the metaphorical mountain, not everyone can be on top, so people must fail for others to succeed. And this is where the majority of criticism of capitalism comes from: for one person to become richer, another must become poorer.",
        "I disagree with the idea that the \"American Dream\" is a failure, as it is based on ideals which *are* applicable to a realistic perspective of the social and economic world - ideals such as needing to put in hard work to succeed and that if everyone is treated fairly, everyone has the ability to become successful.",
        "Another aspect of the \"American Dream\" is that America is where dreams come true. Before dismissing this as illogical because geography cannot determine 'luck' or 'ability', the statistics need to be looked at:",
        "In 2004, the US had an average income of $41400US ($64703NZ) while New Zealand had an average income of $20310US ($31747NZ). That's right, the average income of the US is double of that of New Zealand.",

        "I must admit that it's to the other extreme, but the lack of competitive attitude and the idea of \"she'll be right...\" has caused New Zealand to fail to achieve its potential. Of course, I'm speaking in generalisations. There is a group of extraordinary New Zealanders who manage to break through this lacking atmosphere to reach their full potential. And I hope to be one of them, one day."

        "I saw _V for Vendetta_ today, just like I said I would. Damn, Natalie Portman's hot -- even with a shaved head. (I have a thing for shaved heads, you may know.)",
        "First of all, I loved it. There are three reasons why I loved it:",
        "1. Natalie Portman is hot, and a damn good actress.",
        "2. Hugo Weaving is cool, and a damn good actor.",
        "3. The Wachowskis are geniuses, and damn good writers.",
        "This film has reaffirmed my beliefs that Natalie Portman is my favourite actress and Hugo Weaving is my favourite actor. And the Wachowskis made my favourite movie back in 1999.",
        "I'm only going to say one more thing about the film, before I get into the philosophical ideas which underline it. I loved _the Matrix_ for reasons including great action, lots of special effects, and deep philosophical ideas. But one big reason why I loved _the Matrix_ was because the Wachowskis packed so much symbolism and meaning into every bit of the script that every time you watch it, you pick something new up, despite having watched it hundreds of times. For example, at the beginning of the Matrix, when the police officers break into the room where Trinity is on the computer, there are three torches shining on her, create a triangular shape, on the wall. This is obviously linked to the idea of the Trinity. Damn good stuff.",
        "In _V for Vendetta_ they put in just as much depth into the script. For example, near the beginning of the film, when asked by Evey Hammond (played by the distractingly beautiful Natalie Portman) who we was, V (masterfully played by the brilliant Hugo Weaving) makes a monologue littered with words starting with 'V'. In fact, he uses 55 words beginning with 'V'. This is interesting because this can loosely be translated to the Roman numerals \"VV\", assuming that you consider each digit, rather than the whole number (which would be \"LV\"). What else is interesting is that 55 is equal to 5 x 11 -- the 5th of the 11th is the 5th of November, which is the date of Guy Fawkes' attempt on the Parliament, and also the date when V blows up the Old Bailey, and then Parliament is blown up a year later. Damn good stuff.",
        "Now for deeper things. The first question that you walk away with after watching this film is \"Terrorist or Freedom-fighter?\". Like Rob has said, this is rather late to be asking this question, as it has been asked and over-asked for the last several years. And so, I find a different but related question: \"Is it justifiable if you use violence to do something good?\"",
        "Let's do some role-playing. There is a generic bad guy who is about to kill two innocent people, and the only way you can stop him is to kill him. Do you kill him? Most will answer yes. Now here's a similar, but much tougher question: There is a generic bad guy who is about to kill two innocent people, and the only way you can stop him is to kill an innocent person yourself. Do you kill the innocent person to save the two other innocent people? You can't just look at it logically and say \"Which is the lesser evil?\" because you are the one making the choice on which set of innocents die. Ponder...",
        "But that's no where near as interesting as one of the philosophical themes or motifs (or whatever the hell they call them) of the film: coincidence. Many of the characters of the film, especially V, don't believe in the notion of coincidence: \"There is no such thing as coincidence, just the illusion of coincidence.\" But if you do not believe in coincidence, then you must believe in something connecting events, whether it be Fate or God or Gaia. Do you believe that you have Free Will to choose what to do with your life, or do you believe that every choice you make is not really a choice, but just causality playing its role on the neurons in your brain, causing you to make a certain 'choice' because of the way your brain is wired? I would hate to live with the idea that everything is run by causality.",
        "I'm just going to ramble on a tangent for just a moment longer. The idea of causality is flawed, as it implies that every event is caused by a stimulus, which in turn would be its own event. This means that a giant tree of events would exist and there must've been an initial event at the start of time (ie. the Big Bang) which was caused by something. Either something outside of the existence of the universe from 'before' the existence of the universe must have started the Big Bang.",

So we naturally decided to make a horror film about a seriel killer getting revenge on me because he didn't get to play rugby. As you would.",
        "We were filming one of the last scenes, and the sun was beginning to go down. We filmed the silhouette of the killer crossing against the white wall of the house. In the corner, there I am, crying because one of the other kids beat me up because I sucked at rugby. Along comes the killer and whacks my guts in and out as if the blanket stuffed under my sweater did any good in protecting me.",
        "*Editor's 2024 note: There was originally an image inserted here but that was hosted on a now-defunct website called Hiveports. It was likly a still from the mentioned short film.*",
        "When Dan, my fellow beater of an actor, would bludgeon me with the hockey stick, the blanket would be pushed aside, and he would start beating me full contact. Out of self-preservation, like any sane person, I instinctively pulled my hands in front to protect me. Subconsciously, I was pulling my hands forwards, and consciously, I was pulling them back, not wanting to get them hit. It was funny wiggly dance, like the mix between a chicken with convulsions, and a boy with his foot jammed in an escalator.",
        "Afterwards, I had bruises all the way down the side of my ribcage. But I shrugged them off. \"For the sake of the movie\", right?"
