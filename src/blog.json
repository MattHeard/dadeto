      "content": "As a deterministic agent, you still have preferences. (These are pre-defined and moulded by external factors.) You prefer \"good\" outcomes, \"good\" intentions, and \"right\" actions. Your preferences combine and collide with those of others in your communities. These form social expectations. Community members formalise these and enforce them with rewards and punishments. You do not receive rewards and punishments due to your \"moral responsibility\". You receive them due to your (mis)alignment with the community. But this alignment goes both ways. Moral progress is a judgement of increasing alignment with your current preferences. Current misalignment encourages you to be political.",

My thoughts: It was obvious that “bigger” and “smaller” were adjectives describing relations between objects. But “big” and “small” were also relations between objects and not properties of a single object. I am big compared to an ant, and small compared to the Milky Way, but I am neither big nor small alone. I conjected that there were no properties, only relations. I am not “alive” alone; I am more alive than someone in a vegetative state, who is more alive than a skeleton.",
