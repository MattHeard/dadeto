        "As a deterministic agent, you still have preferences. (These are pre-defined and moulded by external factors.) You prefer \"good\" outcomes, \"good\" intentions, and \"right\" actions. Your preferences combine and collide with those of others in your communities. These form social expectations. Community members formalise these and enforce them with rewards and punishments. You do not receive rewards and punishments due to your \"moral responsibility\". You receive them due to your (mis)alignment with the community. But this alignment goes both ways. Moral progress is a judgement of increasing alignment with your current preferences. Current misalignment encourages you to be political."

        "Søren Kierkegaard wrote in \"Fear and Trembling\" about Abraham sacrificing his son. Despite its contradiction with universal moral norms, Abraham was willing to obey God. This is Kierkegaard's example of \"teleological suspension of the ethical\". Here, the duty to obey God supersedes moral duty. I'm interested in coherent moral codes, which allow for determinate decision-making. I would frame this obedience to God as a \"trumping\" duty within a pluralistic moral framework. Reasoning drives quotidian decisions but a command from God would override that all. Kierkegaard appears to object to fitting this sublime duty of obedience into morality. Seems odd."

Many disagree about whether to divert the trolley. Some would choose to divert the trolley to minimize the number harmed. Others would refuse to divert the trolley, possibly because harm caused is worse than harm allowed. The lack of consensus can teach us about moral pluralism. Moral pluralism means different people have different moral values and moral codes. The Trolley Problem offers a framework for discussing and appreciating actual moral pluralism."

For example, there are reports of child labour and forced labour in the extraction of cobalt in the DRC. Lithium extraction is also water-intensive, impacting local ecosystems. Pausing or delaying the mining isn't the solution. Mining is essential for the transition away from fossil fuels. Instead, the focus should be on improving conditions and ethical sourcing. Failure to raise environmental and labour standards will extend our fossil fuel dependency."

Permitted actions are those which one may or may not do. When searching for a moral code to guide their lives, people look for a system of principles, justifications, and directions for how to act. This makes restrictive religious standards popular and powerful. Alternatively, if a moral code primarily consists of only permitted actions, people can't use the moral code to make decisive choices because they are given too much wiggle room."

The cynic in me entertains the possibility that the Syrian passport found by one killer's body was a prop to brew distrust of all Syrian refugees. It is unknown whether it belonged to the killer. All of the other suspects or identified killers appear to be Belgian or French. To retaliate against refugees who are fleeing these killers would compound the tragedy. I hope for a calm, measured response."

Despite enthusiasts' suspicion and hostility to the announcement, Facebook's acquisition of Oculus gives it a prime position for hosting the Street-like public hub. However, the majority of social interactions will be in private rooms like the Black Sun and Hiro Protagonist's office in _Snow Crash_. A federated social network could allow a heavy user to self-host and a casual user to connect through Facebook and both share the same virtual space. Rooms could establish realism standards and exclude avatars which break the immersion, encouraging investment in new designs."

But could even the greatest engineer in electronics rebuild or repair a CPU? Blunt tools would be insufficient for the nano-scale precision required. Some materials, such as rare earth metals, might be impossible to find. Some technology production clearly relies on multibillion dollar infrastructure."

If actresses need better roles to prove they are as talented as men, better roles need to be written. No matter how you feel about the character, it is clear that _Gone Girl_'s Amy is such a role."

The cyclist stopped to let me cross, and then pedalled hard to regain his lost momentum after I was across. This isn't very sensible. Cyclists have a much harder time decelerating and accelerating than pedestrians and drivers. Pedestrians should give way to cyclists so that they can maintain their momentum and use rolling stops instead of actual stops. It's arguably safer, too. Accidents might happen if a pedestrian assumes cyclists can stop quickly."

Deontologists blame the aggressor entirely: the victim had a right to not be harmed. Consequentialists might argue that the student knew the risks and is partially responsible for the consequences of their choice. This is uncomfortable logic. In response we can either (1) reject consequentialism, (2) accept that we should blame victims (at least privately), or (3) refine the consequentialist calculus to stop victim-blaming. Maybe we could argue that optimal consequences require systems of rights?"
