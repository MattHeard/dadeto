# src

This directory contains the main source code for Dadeto. It is organized into subfolders by concern:

- `browser`: utilities and helpers for browser environments.
- `build`: tooling for asset and bundle generation.
- `cloud`: Firebase functions and other backend adapters.
- `core`: shared logic used across environments, including constants and browser adapters (`core/browser/inputHandlers`, `core/browser/presenters`, `core/browser/toys`).
- `node`: Node-specific entry points and helpers.
- `scripts`: development and build scripts.
- `blog.json`: sample data used during development.
