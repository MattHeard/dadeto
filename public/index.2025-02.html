      <p class="value">As a deterministic agent, you still have preferences. (These are pre-defined and moulded by external factors.) You prefer "good" outcomes, "good" intentions, and "right" actions. Your preferences combine and collide with those of others in your communities. These form social expectations. Community members formalise these and enforce them with rewards and punishments. You do not receive rewards and punishments due to your "moral responsibility". You receive them due to your (mis)alignment with the community. But this alignment goes both ways. Moral progress is a judgement of increasing alignment with your current preferences. Current misalignment encourages you to be political.</p>

      <p class="value">Søren Kierkegaard wrote in "Fear and Trembling" about Abraham sacrificing his son. Despite its contradiction with universal moral norms, Abraham was willing to obey God. This is Kierkegaard's example of "teleological suspension of the ethical". Here, the duty to obey God supersedes moral duty. I'm interested in coherent moral codes, which allow for determinate decision-making. I would frame this obedience to God as a "trumping" duty within a pluralistic moral framework. Reasoning drives quotidian decisions but a command from God would override that all. Kierkegaard appears to object to fitting this sublime duty of obedience into morality. Seems odd.</p>

      <p class="value">In the Trolley Problem, a runaway trolley is about to kill five people. You can divert it to another track, but if you do, another person will die instead. Many disagree about whether to divert the trolley. Some would choose to divert the trolley to minimize the number harmed. Others would refuse to divert the trolley, possibly because harm caused is worse than harm allowed. The lack of consensus can teach us about moral pluralism. Moral pluralism means different people have different moral values and moral codes. The Trolley Problem offers a framework for discussing and appreciating actual moral pluralism.</p>

      <p class="value">Battery technology is crucial for mitigating climate change. But the materials often come from countries with lax environmental and labor protections. For example, there are reports of child labour and forced labour in the extraction of cobalt in the DRC. Lithium extraction is also water-intensive, impacting local ecosystems. Pausing or delaying the mining isn't the solution. Mining is essential for the transition away from fossil fuels. Instead, the focus should be on improving conditions and ethical sourcing. Failure to raise environmental and labour standards will extend our fossil fuel dependency.</p>

Guessing what ten more years will look like is hard. We already struggle to predict the current pace of technology. We also can't be sure how people or governments will respond to these new tools. We don't know how they might want to direct its development. We should be careful and thoughtful, taking responsibility for how we use it. All while assuming everyone else will rush to use it.</p>

      <p class="value">As he climbed those stairs, the music rang familiar. Listening closely, I realized it was a remix, but this was Justice! Justice is one of my favorite French electronic bands, and it made perfect sense since the scene was set in Paris.</p>

      <p class="value">There are three categories of moral actions: forbidden, required, and permitted. Forbidden actions are those which one must not do. Required actions are those which one must do. Permitted actions are those which one may or may not do. When searching for a moral code to guide their lives, people look for a system of principles, justifications, and directions for how to act. This makes restrictive religious standards popular and powerful. Alternatively, if a moral code primarily consists of only permitted actions, people can't use the moral code to make decisive choices because they are given too much wiggle room.</p>

      <p class="value">If we assume that the Islamic State coordinated the November 2015 attacks on Paris, it should be quickly obvious that such an attack intended to encourage a backlash against Islamic refugees. The cynic in me entertains the possibility that the Syrian passport found by one killer's body was a prop to brew distrust of all Syrian refugees. It is unknown whether it belonged to the killer. All of the other suspects or identified killers appear to be Belgian or French. To retaliate against refugees who are fleeing these killers would compound the tragedy. I hope for a calm, measured response.</p>

      <p class="value">The second trailer to _Jurassic World_ shows Beth (Bryce Dallas Howard) telling Owen (Chris Pratt) that the scientists have genetically modified a dinosaur to keep the park audiences interested. Owen scoffs that dinosaurs are already interesting. "Corporate felt genetic modification would up the 'wow factor'." "They're dinosaurs. 'Wow' enough." I reacted similarly and rolled my eyes when they mentioned genetic modification in the first trailer, but now think that maybe the filmmakers are commenting on the nature of the _Jurassic Park_ film franchise. The filmmakers clearly thought that the new film also needed something extra to keep their audiences interested.</p>

      <p class="value">Immersive virtual reality experiences may be only years, if not months, away. Despite enthusiasts' suspicion and hostility to the announcement, Facebook's acquisition of Oculus gives it a prime position for hosting the Street-like public hub. However, the majority of social interactions will be in private rooms like the Black Sun and Hiro Protagonist's office in _Snow Crash_. A federated social network could allow a heavy user to self-host and a casual user to connect through Facebook and both share the same virtual space. Rooms could establish realism standards and exclude avatars which break the immersion, encouraging investment in new designs.</p>

      <p class="value">If World War III ended with a few scrappy scavengers in a desolate, nuclear wasteland, I can imagine several technologies being easy to rebuild. A wheel is simple and could be crudely constructed by anyone. With some engineering experience, you could likely find the scraps and basic tools needed to build something like a water pump. But could even the greatest engineer in electronics rebuild or repair a CPU? Blunt tools would be insufficient for the nano-scale precision required. Some materials, such as rare earth metals, might be impossible to find. Some technology production clearly relies on multibillion dollar infrastructure.</p>

      <p class="value">Emily St. James claimed that _Gone Girl_ is a feminist film, but her article seems more interested in shocking up page views than in making a convincing argument. While I can see _Gone Girl_ as a favourite of MRAs and red-pillers, I see it as a film advancing feminism too. _Gone Girl_ presents a strong female villain which almost never exists. If actresses need better roles to prove they are as talented as men, better roles need to be written. No matter how you feel about the character, it is clear that _Gone Girl_'s Amy is such a role.</p>

      <p class="value">I was thinking about victim-blaming and consequentialism as I walked home yesterday and as I crossed a pedestrian crossing, a cyclist was coming quickly down the road. The cyclist stopped to let me cross, and then pedalled hard to regain his lost momentum after I was across. This isn't very sensible. Cyclists have a much harder time decelerating and accelerating than pedestrians and drivers. Pedestrians should give way to cyclists so that they can maintain their momentum and use rolling stops instead of actual stops. It's arguably safer, too. Accidents might happen if a pedestrian assumes cyclists can stop quickly.</p>

      <p class="value">A student wishes to take a shortcut through a dark alleyway and knows they risk being attacked. They take the shortcut anyway, and get mugged. Deontologists blame the aggressor entirely: the victim had a right to not be harmed. Consequentialists might argue that the student knew the risks and is partially responsible for the consequences of their choice. This is uncomfortable logic. In response we can either (1) reject consequentialism, (2) accept that we should blame victims (at least privately), or (3) refine the consequentialist calculus to stop victim-blaming. Maybe we could argue that optimal consequences require systems of rights?</p>

      <p class="value">I try to eat lots of vegan food. The livestock industry produces somewhere between 18% and 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions and eating less meat and dairy is the easiest way to reduce the pollution you cause. Pure veganism, though, can be a chore when you are pelted with advertising for beef and milk. Applying the Pareto principle, 80% of the reduction could probably be done for 20% of the effort, and vice versa. Convince others that 80% veganism is easy and more emissions will be reduced than trying and failing to convince people to go straight to 100%.</p>

I think the financial arguments being put forth are very convincing: fossil fuel companies likely have a lot of reserves which are going to be stranded as people take climate change more seriously and investment funds which have a long-term focus should be calculating this into their investment strategies. But if the purpose is to starve fossil fuel companies of investment, can it ever succeed? Part of my scepticism comes from a worry that other investors will happily buy the divested shares because their price-to-earnings ratio is slightly lower.</p>

I worry about this myself. What I found most interesting in what he wrote, though, was the effect of inclusive group names and labels. Labelling an organisation "Princeton Men and Women Opposed to Proposition 174" encouraged more advocacy for other genders than "Princeton Opponents of Proposition 174". _Feminism_ is a label used to describe advocacy for women's rights. But it also extends to the promotion of gender equality for everyone. Is the label "feminist" exclusive?</p>

After adjusting for inflation, someone in 1937 would need to have picked over half a US ton of peaches to pay for the piña colada I had. Nonetheless, the novel has unrelenting optimism about perserverence through hardship. Meanwhile, Benjamin Graham made 14.7% per annum during the Great Depression.</p>

      <p class="value">Yashar Ali wrote a good summary of how dismissing women's negative reactions to sexism can make women feel like they are being irrational. There is an unfair stereotype that women are crazy, so if a woman responds to sexism in a negative way, she must be 'overreacting'. Saying "you're so sensitive!" undermines her perspective. Some people see this rejection of women's opinions as inconsiderate, most don't notice it at all. But it fuels a cruel stereotype by muting women's viewpoints, as it seeds self-doubt and self-censoring. If this causes women to be hesitant to speak up, communities lose valuable voices.</p>

I have been curious about 'objective' algorithms for sorting by spine colour because some multi-colour books, like Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Antifragile, just refuse to be cleanly categorised. What about fitting spine rectangles into a 2-dimensional bookcase rectangle, optimising for minimal distance between similarly coloured pixels?</p>

I rolled my eyes and thought about how overrated they were, but then felt bad. The patterned leggings actually look pretty cool, and I reckon that Instagram has worked well as a word-of-mouth platform. I don't wear them myself, but I think I might be the kind of person to post photos of how they looked if I did. I don't particularly care about leggings, but I just thought it was interesting how I reacted negatively to a stream of photos.</p>

      <p class="value">One of the sexiest things I've ever seen was one of my best friends impressing a girl by reciting Lewis Caroll's 'Jabberwocky' to her from memory. The poem shows why Alice's pair of books are incredibly insightful into the puzzles of language. Half of the words (like 'vorpal' and 'chortle') are made up, but the words still have meanings (even if Alice doesn't 'exactly know what they are'). We derive meanings from context, allowing us to learn new vocabulary. Even when half of the words are made up, we can understand them from how they reflect off of known words.</p>

      <p class="value">Where does the line get drawn about what can be said? Dissent? Ignorant hatred? Inciting imminent violence? Trolling religious zealots? I generally believe that the better response to hate speech is more speech, presented in a civil manner, to expose the ignorance of the haters. But how does that protect the victims of hate speech? When racial slurs are aimed at children, how should a liberal respond? A hedonistic liberal would say that liberty is virtuous only for the sake of making people happier. Freedom of speech almost always does that, but I can imagine situations when it does not.</p>

      <p class="value">As I hope you have noticed, I put at least as much effort into visually laying out my blog posts as I do into writing them. I carefully use Markdown to format my text and GIMP to shoop my decorative images maybe obsessively. So, when the Tumblr app on my phone strips my drafts of their formatting, it frustrates me. Back when I was a teenager, I would evangelise OpenOffice.org as a reasonable alternative to Microsoft Office, but it was difficult to justify making my documents look nice if exporting to Word was just going to butcher the layout.</p>

      <p class="value">_Sucker Punch_ suffers from problems like poor pacing and shallow character depth, but while the form has obscured the message, the message is much more interesting than the story or visual effects. On one side of the coin, you are presented with a criticism of modern female exploitation: these animated exaggerations are not real women -- they are geek fantasies. But on the other side, the film is shamelessly indulging in the very fetishes it criticises. The sucker punch is thrown at the audience, drawing them in to see a video game fantasy, and then reprimanding them by breaking their toys.</p>

      <p class="value">When someone is criminally punished only for driving while intoxicated, they are not being punished for an action which caused harm but because they performed a combination of actions which are statistically significantly linked with harm being caused. Due to an element of moral "luck", it is certainly possible for a drunk or high driver to drive somewhere without causing harm but we still consider that criminal. How does the act consequentialist reconcile this? Argue that driving drunk is not intrinsically wrong? Or develop a possibly convoluted argument for how each individual action of driving drunk somehow causes harm indirectly?</p>

      <p class="value">I was arguing/discussing with my future wife about what is considered "art". I believe that the artist's intentions are irrelevant and that whether something is "art" is determined by how the viewer observes it.  Looking for counterexamples and illustrations, I asked her: would you consider it possible for a computer program to be "art"? I would, but she wasn't sure. Undoubtedly, almost all computer programs are primarily functional, but there is elegant code and there is inelegant code. Does elegance make code artistic?  If it does, I should start a gallery of clips of elegant code from open-source software.</p>

A soldier going to war risks much more than I do when I go to work, but I do not believe they get a "heroism" bonus in their paycheck. Instead, our social contract teaches us to "pay" them our respect. A similar honour is bestowed upon public servants with life-threatening careers such as firefighting and law enforcement. Do we have a duty to remember and enshrine our valiant?</p>

      <p class="value">My understanding of compassion in free market economics is that reducing the prices of goods and services through increasing market efficiency will help poor _consumers_ more than government intervention will help poor _workers_. But there are barriers to entry which are avoidable and are not caused by government intervention. Does aversion to multiculturalism act as a barrier to entry? When a fat, white woman yells "Speak English!" at a Chinese shopkeeper, the shopkeeper pays a hidden cost to continue working. In a maximally competitive market, where race shouldn't affect labour, neither should foreign cultural expression. More tolerance brings more competition.</p>

Balancing the goals of prosecuting trespassers and keeping the peace is undeniably a difficult task, but I think that "perception" of police brutality against protesters creates a Streisand effect by rallying more support for the protesters and encouraging rioters and violent opportunists.  Wouldn't it be better to videotape any non-violent crimes (like trespassing) and not evict protesters, waiting for them leave out of boredom? The police can then prosecute peacefully later.</p>

      <p class="value">This Arctic summer has broken records for the least sea ice in recent history. Lots of that melted ice will return this winter, but the total thick ice is decreasing. There are two issues to note. First, this melting trend exemplifies the clarity of the physical evidence for global warming. While Arctic sea ice levels alone do not establish human attribution, they identify much-needed climatic research. Second, the distinction between single- and multi-year ice highlights feedback loops. As more ice thaws and refreezes, less remains thick enough to maintain the albedo needed to prevent extra absorption of sunlight, accelerating warming.</p>

I wouldn't consider my opinions worth blogging about if I didn't. But I don't think that my blog was intended as a soapbox for me to grab attention. 21st century identities are forged much more so on the internet than 20th century identities, and with a blog and a Twitter handle and a Facebook wall and a Google+ profile, I can manage the definition of "Matt Heard" more effectively.

      <p class="value">I have a habit of reading in sprints, consuming several books in one month and then not picking up any for the next several months. My future wife and I challenged each other to read more by starting from one end of our bookcase and reading each book one at a time. I just finished my second book: _Introducing Political Philosophy_. I was cheating, though, because it is short and each page has a large picture. But it's interesting and seems to be a good summary of the history of political thought. My next is _Brave New World_ by Aldous Huxley.</p>

      <p class="value">"Why must everybody like you? Who liked J. P. Morgan? Was he impressive? In a Turkish bath he'd look like a butcher. But with his pockets on he was very well liked." (Miller, 72)</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">First of all, I was disappointed by Circa's 3rd of May performance of "Death of a Salesman" - not because the play was so badly done (it was great), but instead because my expectations were so high. For the few days before viewing it, I received the notion that the play in general, and also this Circa presentation of it were brilliant. I heard nothing but criticism for both, and so my expectations ran rampant and free.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">I criticise the play in general for trying so hard to be depressing, and although it succeeded at achieving this, it seems like a cheap attraction for audiences. We go to horror films to watch people in situations we wouldn't enjoy being in ourselves - watch _Saw_ or its sequel. (I haven't watched _Saw_ but from the impression I get from others who have watched it, it's addictive in a disturbing way.) I believe that people watch depressing films and plays to cheer themselves up, and I disagree with how a lot of people believe that making a film or play depressing makes it a better film or play.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">The play presents the idea of the "American Dream" and how it fails to transfer from an idealistic perspective of the social and economic world to a realistic perspective. The main fault of the idea is that although everyone may be capable of achieving success and reaching the top of the metaphorical mountain, not everyone can be on top, so people must fail for others to succeed. And this is where the majority of criticism of capitalism comes from: for one person to become richer, another must become poorer.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">I disagree with the idea that the "American Dream" is a failure, as it is based on ideals which *are* applicable to a realistic perspective of the social and economic world - ideals such as needing to put in hard work to succeed and that if everyone is treated fairly, everyone has the ability to become successful.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">Another aspect of the "American Dream" is that America is where dreams come true. Before dismissing this as illogical because geography cannot determine 'luck' or 'ability', the statistics need to be looked at:</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">In 2004, the US had an average income of $41400US ($64703NZ) while New Zealand had an average income of $20310US ($31747NZ). That's right, the average income of the US is double of that of New Zealand.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">I'm not trying to show off or anything; my point is that the US is a land of opportunity because there is a different atmosphere of competition and hard work.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">In California, school was all about competition. You had to get better than a B (85%) on every test to stay in the top class, and that isn't easy. I had a friend who was scared to tell his parents that he got less than 90% on a Biology exam.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">I must admit that it's to the other extreme, but the lack of competitive attitude and the idea of "she'll be right..." has caused New Zealand to fail to achieve its potential. Of course, I'm speaking in generalisations. There is a group of extraordinary New Zealanders who manage to break through this lacking atmosphere to reach their full potential. And I hope to be one of them, one day.</p>

      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">_Scary Movie 4_:</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">I went to the theatre and it was packed with 13-15 year olds. I always wanted it to be less of a spoof movie and more like the original _Scary Movie_ (more violent and sexually vulgar) so that those damn kids wouldn't keep laughing at the wrong times. Oh, well.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">I can't really make any analytical commentary of it, as all allusions to other films are parodies and are meant to be blatent and obvious.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">One thing that I can say is that there wasn't enough of Leslie Nielsen, the king of spoof acting. If you like watching parody films such as _Airplane!_ and _the Naked Gun_, you'll remember Nielsen's great contributions to the spoof genre. As the President of the US of A, Nielsen brought back this amazing humour, but I must say that there wasn't enough of it.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">A funny scene with the President listening to a girl reading a story about a duck when he finds out about the alien invasion, parodying when Bush kept listening to a story about a goat after hearing about the September 11 attacks.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">Aide: "Sir, our planet is under attack by an alien invasion."</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">Pres: "Okay, but I just want to see what happens with this duck."</p>

      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">_Closer_:</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">I know it's an old film, but I've been wanting to see it because I love Natalie Portman (films), if you didn't know.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">Natalie Portman was great, but then again, I'm biased.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">What I loved about the film was Portman's character, "Alice". The character had the irony that while being the most honest and virtuous character, she had the least socially acceptable occupation (as a stripper).</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">"Alice"'s real name is Jane Jones, and that's what she calls hersefl when she's a stripper. But when she meets Dan (played by Jude Law), she takes on the pseudonym of "Alice Ayres", and stops being a stripper. When she strips for Larry (played by Clive Owen), she returns to New York with her dyed hair and her real name. But every time she's around Dan, she has a natural hair colour, has a job as a cafe waitress, and calls herself "Alice". What I'm trying to say is that since her coloured hair and wigs and stripping job are linked to her real name, those things are what defines her.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">I must say, she makes a damn fine stripper, and apparently there were deleted shots of full frontal nudity. Hah hah... Calum knows what I'm talking about.</p>

      <p class="value">I saw _V for Vendetta_ today, just like I said I would. Damn, Natalie Portman's hot -- even with a shaved head. (I have a thing for shaved heads, you may know.)</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">First of all, I loved it. There are three reasons why I loved it:</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">1. Natalie Portman is hot, and a damn good actress.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">2. Hugo Weaving is cool, and a damn good actor.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">3. The Wachowskis are geniuses, and damn good writers.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">This film has reaffirmed my beliefs that Natalie Portman is my favourite actress and Hugo Weaving is my favourite actor. And the Wachowskis made my favourite movie back in 1999.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">I'm only going to say one more thing about the film, before I get into the philosophical ideas which underline it. I loved _the Matrix_ for reasons including great action, lots of special effects, and deep philosophical ideas. But one big reason why I loved _the Matrix_ was because the Wachowskis packed so much symbolism and meaning into every bit of the script that every time you watch it, you pick something new up, despite having watched it hundreds of times. For example, at the beginning of the Matrix, when the police officers break into the room where Trinity is on the computer, there are three torches shining on her, create a triangular shape, on the wall. This is obviously linked to the idea of the Trinity. Damn good stuff.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">In _V for Vendetta_ they put in just as much depth into the script. For example, near the beginning of the film, when asked by Evey Hammond (played by the distractingly beautiful Natalie Portman) who we was, V (masterfully played by the brilliant Hugo Weaving) makes a monologue littered with words starting with 'V'. In fact, he uses 55 words beginning with 'V'. This is interesting because this can loosely be translated to the Roman numerals "VV", assuming that you consider each digit, rather than the whole number (which would be "LV"). What else is interesting is that 55 is equal to 5 x 11 -- the 5th of the 11th is the 5th of November, which is the date of Guy Fawkes' attempt on the Parliament, and also the date when V blows up the Old Bailey, and then Parliament is blown up a year later. Damn good stuff.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">Now for deeper things. The first question that you walk away with after watching this film is "Terrorist or Freedom-fighter?". Like Rob has said, this is rather late to be asking this question, as it has been asked and over-asked for the last several years. And so, I find a different but related question: "Is it justifiable if you use violence to do something good?"</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">Let's do some role-playing. There is a generic bad guy who is about to kill two innocent people, and the only way you can stop him is to kill him. Do you kill him? Most will answer yes. Now here's a similar, but much tougher question: There is a generic bad guy who is about to kill two innocent people, and the only way you can stop him is to kill an innocent person yourself. Do you kill the innocent person to save the two other innocent people? You can't just look at it logically and say "Which is the lesser evil?" because you are the one making the choice on which set of innocents die. Ponder...</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">But that's no where near as interesting as one of the philosophical themes or motifs (or whatever the hell they call them) of the film: coincidence. Many of the characters of the film, especially V, don't believe in the notion of coincidence: "There is no such thing as coincidence, just the illusion of coincidence." But if you do not believe in coincidence, then you must believe in something connecting events, whether it be Fate or God or Gaia. Do you believe that you have Free Will to choose what to do with your life, or do you believe that every choice you make is not really a choice, but just causality playing its role on the neurons in your brain, causing you to make a certain 'choice' because of the way your brain is wired? I would hate to live with the idea that everything is run by causality.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">I'm just going to ramble on a tangent for just a moment longer. The idea of causality is flawed, as it implies that every event is caused by a stimulus, which in turn would be its own event. This means that a giant tree of events would exist and there must've been an initial event at the start of time (ie. the Big Bang) which was caused by something. Either something outside of the existence of the universe from 'before' the existence of the universe must have started the Big Bang.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">Wow, that's really off-topic.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">"Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is it vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished, as the once vital voice of the verisimilitude now venerates what they once vilified. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose vis-à-vis an introduction, and so it is my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V."</p>

      <p class="value">Another note: rebellion.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">I'm off to see "V for Vendetta" tomorrow, which I expect to be good, which in some way is tied to rebellion.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">Irony #2 of the evening: Rebellion is socially cool.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">Elvis Presley, Eminem, and even Michael Jackson used rebellion to increase the volume of their image and succeeded. Elvis Presley is famous for going on the Ed Sullivan show without any pants on. (They had to film him from the waist up.)</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">But in the sense that rebellion is non-conformity and popularity is conformity, you arrive to the conclusion that the contradiction is too great for the rebellion to be honest.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">There are four types of people in this world:</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">1. The first group is all the people who do something that is socially "cool" because everyone else is doing it. This is blatant conformity. This includes all the 3rd Form girls with short shorts and short skirts at Edgefest, who stand out in the foyer the whole time, because the only reason they went was to socialise instead of listen to music.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">2. The second group is all of the people who say "Fuck Edgefest" because everyone else is saying it. Sadly, this is blatant conformity. I must admit that I hate these people more -- the people who call themselves non-conformists, but are actually conforming to the idea of non-conformity (if that makes sense).</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">3. The third group is all of the people who go to Edgefest because they honestly like POD and the Presidents of the USA. This group is all of the people who wore a t-shirt and jeans to Edgefest. These are what I call honest non-conformists. They go to Edgefest -- not to socialise, but to listen to damn good music. I would like to consider myself in this group, but I did stand in the foyer during the crappy music.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">4. The fourth and most interesting group is all the people who say "Fuck Edgefest" and mean it. They say "fuck" not because it's rebellious, but because they mean it. These are the guys who are willing to take on the world over what type of music they listen to. So... cool... in an ironic kind of way.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">Instead of doing something because everyone else is doing it, instead of not doing something because everyone else is doing it, forget about what everyone else is doing, and just do what you want.</p>
      <div class="key"></div>
      <p class="value">Wow, I've never said "fuck" so many times in a manner of five minutes!</p>
