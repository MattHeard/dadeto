          There is an important difference between _empathy_ and _sympathy_.
          _Empathy_ is sharing some of the same conscious experiences as another
          person. _Sympathy_ is instead feeling compassion towards someone else
          who is suffering. Empathy requires a relation between you and a
          conscious experience. Sympathy does not.

          A philosophical zombie appears to have conscious experience but lacks
          it. A P-zombie can still suffer but it lacks conscious experiences.
          So, one can sympathise with a P-zombie but cannot empathise with it.

          As a deterministic agent, you still have preferences. (These are
          pre-defined and moulded by external factors.) You prefer "good"
          outcomes, "good" intentions, and "right" actions. Your preferences
          combine and collide with those of others in your communities. These
          form social expectations. Community members formalise these and
          enforce them with rewards and punishments. You do not receive rewards
          and punishments due to your "moral responsibility". You receive them
          due to your (mis)alignment with the community. But this alignment goes
          both ways. Moral progress is a judgement of increasing alignment with
          your current preferences. Current misalignment encourages you to be
          political.

          It was obvious that “bigger” and “smaller” were adjectives describing
          relations between objects. But “big” and “small” were also relations
          between objects and not properties of a single object. I am big
          compared to an ant, and small compared to the Milky Way, but I am
          neither big nor small alone. I conjected that there were no
          properties, only relations. I am not “alive” alone; I am more alive
          than someone in a vegetative state, who is more alive than a skeleton.

          _Lonely and Horny_ was a web video series created and acted by Jake
          Hurwitz and Amir Blumenfeld. Amir plays an obnoxious character named
          Ruby who only cares about himself. There’s an interesting speech made

          coherent defence of philosophical egoism that I haven’t seen often.

          Søren Kierkegaard wrote in "Fear and Trembling" about Abraham
          sacrificing his son. Despite its contradiction with universal moral
          norms, Abraham was willing to obey God. This is Kierkegaard's example
          of "teleological suspension of the ethical". Here, the duty to obey
          God supersedes moral duty. I'm interested in coherent moral codes,
          which allow for determinate decision-making. I would frame this
          obedience to God as a "trumping" duty within a pluralistic moral
          framework. Reasoning drives quotidian decisions but a command from God
          would override that all. Kierkegaard appears to object to fitting this
          sublime duty of obedience into morality. Seems odd.

          In the Trolley Problem, a runaway trolley is about to kill five
          people. You can divert it to another track, but if you do, another
          person will die instead. Many disagree about whether to divert the
          trolley. Some would choose to divert the trolley to minimize the
          number harmed. Others would refuse to divert the trolley, possibly
          because harm caused is worse than harm allowed. The lack of consensus
          can teach us about moral pluralism. Moral pluralism means different
          people have different moral values and moral codes. The Trolley
          Problem offers a framework for discussing and appreciating actual
          moral pluralism.

        <p class="value">
          Battery technology is crucial for mitigating climate change. But the
          materials often come from countries with lax environmental and labor
          protections. For example, there are reports of child labour and forced
          labour in the extraction of cobalt in the DRC. Lithium extraction is
          also water-intensive, impacting local ecosystems. Pausing or delaying
          the mining isn't the solution. Mining is essential for the transition
          away from fossil fuels. Instead, the focus should be on improving
          conditions and ethical sourcing. Failure to raise environmental and
          labour standards will extend our fossil fuel dependency. This will
          only entrench the harm of fossil fuel mining.

          AI is taking off, and this year brought new developments like GPT-4,
          Stable Diffusion XL, and llama.cpp. Even if all progress paused, the
          tools we already have could reshape society. Guessing what ten more
          years will look like is hard. We already struggle to predict the
          current pace of technology. We also can't be sure how people or
          governments will respond to these new tools. We don't know how they
          might want to direct its development. We should be careful and
          thoughtful, taking responsibility for how we use it. All while
          assuming everyone else will rush to use it.

          There's a funny scene in John Wick 4 where Wick is climbing a
          staircase, only to have to fight his way up against assailants. He
          gets kicked all the way back down, and has to repeat the ascent.

          Climate change is likely to cause hundreds of millions of extra people
          to die this century. Billions more will suffer. It cannot be

          But preventing climate change is not binary: not only success or only
          failure. It is a matter of degree. With every degree increased,
          millions more suffer. 6° is worse than 5° and 4°.

        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          In turn, 4° is better than 5° and 6°. With every degree averted,
          millions more avoid suffering. So, even small actions have tremendous
          impacts. Choosing to avoid meat, or cycle, or catch a train helps.

          Modularisation in software design is about breaking down simple
          collections of complicated components into complex collections of
          simple components. A complicated component acts incorrectly when you
          cannot understand its internal behavior. A complex collection acts
          unexpectedly when you cannot understand their external interactions.

          All non-trivial software is both complicated and complex, and we can
          refactor to trade-off between complicated and complex designs.
          Object-oriented programmers explored these trade-offs for the last few
          decades and now microservice architects are exploring them too.

          Benjamin Franklin said that time was money. You could have earned ten
          shillings today, but you spent half of it sitting idle. You only got
          five shillings for the half-day you did work. To Franklin, you spent
          (or threw away) the other five shillings in front of the television.
          Suppose we talk about ten thousand dollars instead. You would likely
          save a child’s life by donating ten thousand dollars worth of mosquito
          nets. Have you spent (or thrown away) that child’s life by not
          fighting for a raise? Or upgrading a good car for a newer model?

          Our daughter is almost two, and we now also have a two-month old son.
          As I settled him back to sleep after his night feeds, I watched the
          original series of Star Trek on mute with subtitles. After a great
          first season I ordered some wireless headphones and continued
          watching. When they arrived I excitedly set them up, but the sound was
          jarring; I felt like somebody had taken Kirk, Spock, and McCoy and
          dubbed over their original voices. Of course I knew these were their
          voices, but I couldn’t continue watching without feeling like the show
          had become corrupted.

          There are three categories of moral actions: forbidden, required, and
          permitted. Forbidden actions are those which one must not do. Required
          actions are those which one must do. Permitted actions are those which
          one may or may not do. When searching for a moral code to guide their
          lives, people look for a system of principles, justifications, and
          directions for how to act. This makes restrictive religious standards
          popular and powerful. Alternatively, if a moral code primarily
          consists of only permitted actions, people can't use the moral code to
          make decisive choices because they are given too much wiggle room.

          If we assume that the Islamic State coordinated the November 2015
          attacks on Paris, it should be quickly obvious that such an attack
          intended to encourage a backlash against Islamic refugees. The cynic
          in me entertains the possibility that the Syrian passport found by one
          killer's body was a prop to brew distrust of all Syrian refugees. It
          is unknown whether it belonged to the killer. All of the other
          suspects or identified killers appear to be Belgian or French. To
          retaliate against refugees who are fleeing these killers would
          compound the tragedy. I hope for a calm, measured response.

          My daughter Evelyn turns one today. It's a celebration for my wife and
          I as much as it is for our daughter, so I made cupcakes. I did the
          mixing with Evelyn. (She kept eating the flour.) I want to show my
          daughter that baking is not a "mum" activity, and cupcakes have little
          chance of error. They turned out slightly dry, but still great.

          The second trailer to _Jurassic World_ shows Beth (Bryce Dallas
          Howard) telling Owen (Chris Pratt) that the scientists have
          genetically modified a dinosaur to keep the park audiences interested.
          Owen scoffs that dinosaurs are already interesting. "Corporate felt
          genetic modification would up the 'wow factor'." "They're dinosaurs.
          'Wow' enough." I reacted similarly and rolled my eyes when they
          mentioned genetic modification in the first trailer, but now think
          that maybe the filmmakers are commenting on the nature of the
          _Jurassic Park_ film franchise. The filmmakers clearly thought that
          the new film also needed something extra to keep their audiences
          interested.

          Immersive virtual reality experiences may be only years, if not
          months, away. Despite enthusiasts' suspicion and hostility to the
          announcement, Facebook's acquisition of Oculus gives it a prime
          position for hosting the Street-like public hub. However, the majority
          of social interactions will be in private rooms like the Black Sun and
          Hiro Protagonist's office in _Snow Crash_. A federated social network
          could allow a heavy user to self-host and a casual user to connect
          through Facebook and both share the same virtual space. Rooms could
          establish realism standards and exclude avatars which break the
          immersion, encouraging investment in new designs.

          If World War III ended with a few scrappy scavengers in a desolate,
          nuclear wasteland, I can imagine several technologies being easy to
          rebuild. A wheel is simple and could be crudely constructed by anyone.
          With some engineering experience, you could likely find the scraps and
          basic tools needed to build something like a water pump. But could
          even the greatest engineer in electronics rebuild or repair a CPU?
          Blunt tools would be insufficient for the nano-scale precision
          required. Some materials, such as rare earth metals, might be
          impossible to find. Some technology production clearly relies on
          multibillion dollar infrastructure.

          Emily St. James claimed that _Gone Girl_ is a feminist film, but her
          article seems more interested in shocking up page views than in making
          a convincing argument. While I can see _Gone Girl_ as a favourite of
          MRAs and red-pillers, I see it as a film advancing feminism too. _Gone
          Girl_ presents a strong female villain which almost never exists. If
          actresses need better roles to prove they are as talented as men,
          better roles need to be written. No matter how you feel about the
          character, it is clear that _Gone Girl_'s Amy is such a role.

          I was thinking about victim-blaming and consequentialism as I walked
          home yesterday and as I crossed a pedestrian crossing, a cyclist was
          coming quickly down the road. The cyclist stopped to let me cross, and
          then pedalled hard to regain his lost momentum after I was across.
          This isn't very sensible. Cyclists have a much harder time
          decelerating and accelerating than pedestrians and drivers.
          Pedestrians should give way to cyclists so that they can maintain
          their momentum and use rolling stops instead of actual stops. It's
          arguably safer, too. Accidents might happen if a pedestrian assumes
          cyclists can stop quickly.

          A student wishes to take a shortcut through a dark alleyway and knows
          they risk being attacked. They take the shortcut anyway, and get
          mugged. Deontologists blame the aggressor entirely: the victim had a
          right to not be harmed. Consequentialists might argue that the student
          knew the risks and is partially responsible for the consequences of
          their choice. This is uncomfortable logic. In response we can either
          (1) reject consequentialism, (2) accept that we should blame victims
          (at least privately), or (3) refine the consequentialist calculus to
          stop victim-blaming. Maybe we could argue that optimal consequences
          require systems of rights?

          I try to eat lots of vegan food. The livestock industry produces
          somewhere between 18% and 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions and
          eating less meat and dairy is the easiest way to reduce the pollution
          you cause. Pure veganism, though, can be a chore when you are pelted
          with advertising for beef and milk. Applying the Pareto principle, 80%
          of the reduction could probably be done for 20% of the effort, and
          vice versa. Convince others that 80% veganism is easy and more
          emissions will be reduced than trying and failing to convince people
          to go straight to 100%.

          I'm not convinced that divestment from fossil fuel companies is
          effective. I think the financial arguments being put forth are very
          convincing: fossil fuel companies likely have a lot of reserves which
          are going to be stranded as people take climate change more seriously
          and investment funds which have a long-term focus should be
          calculating this into their investment strategies. But if the purpose
          is to starve fossil fuel companies of investment, can it ever succeed?
          Part of my scepticism comes from a worry that other investors will
          happily buy the divested shares because their price-to-earnings ratio
          is slightly lower.

          Adam Grant wrote about the scepticism that men face when exploring
          feminism. ("Was he trying to ingratiate himself with women to improve
          his dating prospects?") I worry about this myself. What I found most
          interesting in what he wrote, though, was the effect of inclusive
          group names and labels. Labelling an organisation "Princeton Men and
          Women Opposed to Proposition 174" encouraged more advocacy for other
          genders than "Princeton Opponents of Proposition 174". _Feminism_ is a
          label used to describe advocacy for women's rights. But it also
          extends to the promotion of gender equality for everyone. Is the label
          "feminist" exclusive?

          I was sitting by a pool in a sunny resort in Fiji. Next to me there
          was a piña colada with condensation beading on the glass. And I
          couldn't put down _The Grapes of Wrath_ by John Steinbeck. The pain
          and poverty of its heroes was jarring against the luxurious, tropical
          backdrop. After adjusting for inflation, someone in 1937 would need to
          have picked over half a US ton of peaches to pay for the piña colada I
          had. Nonetheless, the novel has unrelenting optimism about
          perserverence through hardship. Meanwhile, Benjamin Graham made 14.7%
          per annum during the Great Depression.

          We are all jacks of many trades and experts of only a few, if any.
          Despite this, opinions about everything are easy to develop and even
          easier to publicise. We encounter difficult questions about subjects
          unknown to us, such as climate science. In these situations, it is
          unreasonable to expect us to find our own answers. Instead, we rely on
          experts and we trust their judgment about their topics of study.
          Suppose that you cannot trust experts; they might be colluding to
          mislead you. Can you trust yourself to understand the complex topics
          more than you can trust the experts?

          Yashar Ali wrote a good summary of how dismissing women's negative
          reactions to sexism can make women feel like they are being
          irrational. There is an unfair stereotype that women are crazy, so if
          a woman responds to sexism in a negative way, she must be
          'overreacting'. Saying "you're so sensitive!" undermines her
          perspective. Some people see this rejection of women's opinions as
          inconsiderate, most don't notice it at all. But it fuels a cruel
          stereotype by muting women's viewpoints, as it seeds self-doubt and
          self-censoring. If this causes women to be hesitant to speak up,
          communities lose valuable voices.

          I was reading the newly-launched FiveThirtyEight blog today (it's not
          difficult to notice my nerd crush on Nate Silver) and he used his
          bookcase as an example of the 'trade-off between vividness and
          scalability'. My wife and I have been sorting our books by spine
          colour for a while now, but it's not as impressive as his. I have been
          curious about 'objective' algorithms for sorting by spine colour
          because some multi-colour books, like Nassim Nicholas Taleb's
          Antifragile, just refuse to be cleanly categorised. What about fitting
          spine rectangles into a 2-dimensional bookcase rectangle, optimising
          for minimal distance between similarly coloured pixels?

          I met my wife playing Dungeons & Dragons. The world-building, improv,
          and camaraderie made it feel like the perfect hobby for me, but a few
          factors have caused me to drop it. I'm geographically further away
          from my D&D group than I was during university (albeit most players
          still live in the same city as me) and I don't have as much free time
          to waste on map-making, which was one of the best parts. Finally, the
          stress from juggling increasingly powerful players alongside expanding
          permutations of game-breaking abilities burned me out. Even so, I'm
          feeling drawn to DMing again.

          them myself, but I think I might be the kind of person to post photos
          of how they looked if I did. I don't particularly care about leggings,
          but I just thought it was interesting how I reacted negatively to a
          stream of photos.

          One of the sexiest things I've ever seen was one of my best friends
          impressing a girl by reciting Lewis Caroll's 'Jabberwocky' to her from
          memory. The poem shows why Alice's pair of books are incredibly
          insightful into the puzzles of language. Half of the words (like
          'vorpal' and 'chortle') are made up, but the words still have meanings
          (even if Alice doesn't 'exactly know what they are'). We derive
          meanings from context, allowing us to learn new vocabulary. Even when
          half of the words are made up, we can understand them from how they
          reflect off of known words.

          Where does the line get drawn about what can be said? Dissent?
          Ignorant hatred? Inciting imminent violence? Trolling religious
          zealots? I generally believe that the better response to hate speech
          is more speech, presented in a civil manner, to expose the ignorance
          of the haters. But how does that protect the victims of hate speech?
          When racial slurs are aimed at children, how should a liberal respond?
          A hedonistic liberal would say that liberty is virtuous only for the
          sake of making people happier. Freedom of speech almost always does
          that, but I can imagine situations when it does not.

          As I hope you have noticed, I put at least as much effort into
          visually laying out my blog posts as I do into writing them. I
          carefully use Markdown to format my text and GIMP to shoop my
          decorative images maybe obsessively. So, when the Tumblr app on my
          phone strips my drafts of their formatting, it frustrates me. Back
          when I was a teenager, I would evangelise OpenOffice.org as a
          reasonable alternative to Microsoft Office, but it was difficult to
          justify making my documents look nice if exporting to Word was just
          going to butcher the layout.

          _Sucker Punch_ suffers from problems like poor pacing and shallow
          character depth, but while the form has obscured the message, the
          message is much more interesting than the story or visual effects. On
          one side of the coin, you are presented with a criticism of modern
          female exploitation: these animated exaggerations are not real women
          -- they are geek fantasies. But on the other side, the film is
          shamelessly indulging in the very fetishes it criticises. The sucker
          punch is thrown at the audience, drawing them in to see a video game
          fantasy, and then reprimanding them by breaking their toys.

          When someone is criminally punished only for driving while
          intoxicated, they are not being punished for an action which caused
          harm but because they performed a combination of actions which are
          statistically significantly linked with harm being caused. Due to an
          element of moral "luck", it is certainly possible for a drunk or high
          driver to drive somewhere without causing harm but we still consider
          that criminal. How does the act consequentialist reconcile this? Argue
          that driving drunk is not intrinsically wrong? Or develop a possibly
          convoluted argument for how each individual action of driving drunk
          somehow causes harm indirectly?

          I was arguing/discussing with my future wife about what is considered
          "art". I believe that the artist's intentions are irrelevant and that
          whether something is "art" is determined by how the viewer observes
          it. Looking for counterexamples and illustrations, I asked her: would
          you consider it possible for a computer program to be "art"? I would,
          but she wasn't sure. Undoubtedly, almost all computer programs are
          primarily functional, but there is elegant code and there is inelegant
          code. Does elegance make code artistic? If it does, I should start a
          gallery of clips of elegant code from open-source software.

          I attended a dawn memorial service for ANZAC veterans this morning and
          thought about how annual commemoration for military personnel serves
          as a type of intangible compensation for their unusually sacrificial
          employment. A soldier going to war risks much more than I do when I go
          to work, but I do not believe they get a "heroism" bonus in their
          paycheck. Instead, our social contract teaches us to "pay" them our
          respect. A similar honour is bestowed upon public servants with
          life-threatening careers such as firefighting and law enforcement. Do
          we have a duty to remember and enshrine our valiant?

          My understanding of compassion in free market economics is that
          reducing the prices of goods and services through increasing market
          efficiency will help poor _consumers_ more than government
          intervention will help poor _workers_. But there are barriers to entry
          which are avoidable and are not caused by government intervention.
          Does aversion to multiculturalism act as a barrier to entry? When a
          fat, white woman yells "Speak English!" at a Chinese shopkeeper, the
          shopkeeper pays a hidden cost to continue working. In a maximally
          competitive market, where race shouldn't affect labour, neither should
          foreign cultural expression. More tolerance brings more competition.

          I took some photos of actors I like when I visited the red carpet
          today for the premiere of the first _Hobbit_ film. When I was in high
          school, I rushed with my friends down Kent Terrace towards the Embassy
          Theatre to see if we could get a good spot to see Viggo Mortensen, Ian
          McKellan, Elijah Wood and others at the premiere of _The Return of the
          King_. It was good fun: I remember yelling "Viggo! Viggo! Viggo!" in
          adoration at the top of my lungs. My reaction was more subdued today,
          but I enjoyed seeing glamourous actors again.

          My future wife and I took a scenic rafting trip down the Rangitikei
          River for Christmas last year and earlier this year we picked a random
          weekend to take the trip. That random weekend turned out to be warm
          and sunny, and perfect for a relaxing drift down a river a few hours
          away from home. As expected, the escape from the city made us consider
          quitting our day jobs, even though I haven't even properly started
          mine yet. I'm definitely more at home where there are paved roads and
          cellphone service, but I need adventures too.

          Whether their leaders admit it or not, Republican losses across the
          board in US elections of legislative and executive branches indicate a
          shift away from the Tea Party. But considering the issues needing
          immediate attention, the Democrat gains are not enough to deserve
          substantial celebration: the election doesn't solve the problems with
          the ongoing political stalemate. But there was one clear winner: Nate
          Silver, who stood at the foreground of the battle between
          statisticians and pundits, led the number-crunchers to an overwhelming
          victory. I feel more vindicated as long-time reader of Silver's blog

          After closely following the US presidential election for at least the
          last year, I am actively avoiding reading any news about the results
          today. I am attending an "election party" this evening where we will
          watch the news and tally electoral votes ourselves as the states
          report their results. Unfortunately, because I live in New Zealand,
          the party is effectively time-shifted several hours after the actual
          election. Our party starts at 6pm, when the election will actually be
          wrapping up (waiting only for inconsequential results from a few West

          As I showered this morning, I imagined how I would act as police chief
          in charge of maintaining law and order during an "Occupy Wall
          Street"-style protest. Balancing the goals of prosecuting trespassers
          and keeping the peace is undeniably a difficult task, but I think that
          "perception" of police brutality against protesters creates a
          Streisand effect by rallying more support for the protesters and
          encouraging rioters and violent opportunists. Wouldn't it be better to
          videotape any non-violent crimes (like trespassing) and not evict
          protesters, waiting for them leave out of boredom? The police can then
          prosecute peacefully later.

          Reading Joseph Romm's Language Intelligence has led me to pick up my

          the role that unemotional logic has to play in crafting convincing
          speech. Just as I repeated my lines again and again and again when
          learning to play Friar Lawrence in school, I have been repeating the
          lines of Martin Luther King Jr's "I Have a Dream". Starting with
          _anaphora_ and alliteration, I am keeping a keen eye on figures of

          This Arctic summer has broken records for the least sea ice in recent
          history. Lots of that melted ice will return this winter, but the
          total thick ice is decreasing. There are two issues to note. First,
          this melting trend exemplifies the clarity of the physical evidence
          for global warming. While Arctic sea ice levels alone do not establish
          human attribution, they identify much-needed climatic research.
          Second, the distinction between single- and multi-year ice highlights
          feedback loops. As more ice thaws and refreezes, less remains thick
          enough to maintain the albedo needed to prevent extra absorption of
          sunlight, accelerating warming.

          month and then not picking up any for the next several months. My
          future wife and I challenged each other to read more by starting from
          one end of our bookcase and reading each book one at a time. I just
          finished my second book: _Introducing Political Philosophy_. I was
          cheating, though, because it is short and each page has a large
          picture. But it's interesting and seems to be a good summary of the
          history of political thought. My next is _Brave New World_ by Aldous
          Huxley.

          First of all, I was disappointed by Circa's 3rd of May performance of
          "Death of a Salesman" - not because the play was so badly done (it was
          great), but instead because my expectations were so high. For the few
          days before viewing it, I received the notion that the play in
          general, and also this Circa presentation of it were brilliant. I
          heard nothing but criticism for both, and so my expectations ran
          rampant and free.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          I criticise the play in general for trying so hard to be depressing,
          and although it succeeded at achieving this, it seems like a cheap
          attraction for audiences. We go to horror films to watch people in
          situations we wouldn't enjoy being in ourselves - watch _Saw_ or its
          sequel. (I haven't watched _Saw_ but from the impression I get from
          others who have watched it, it's addictive in a disturbing way.) I
          believe that people watch depressing films and plays to cheer
          themselves up, and I disagree with how a lot of people believe that
          making a film or play depressing makes it a better film or play.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          The play presents the idea of the "American Dream" and how it fails to
          transfer from an idealistic perspective of the social and economic
          world to a realistic perspective. The main fault of the idea is that
          although everyone may be capable of achieving success and reaching the
          top of the metaphorical mountain, not everyone can be on top, so
          people must fail for others to succeed. And this is where the majority
          of criticism of capitalism comes from: for one person to become
          richer, another must become poorer.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          I disagree with the idea that the "American Dream" is a failure, as it
          is based on ideals which *are* applicable to a realistic perspective
          of the social and economic world - ideals such as needing to put in
          hard work to succeed and that if everyone is treated fairly, everyone
          has the ability to become successful.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          Another aspect of the "American Dream" is that America is where dreams
          come true. Before dismissing this as illogical because geography
          cannot determine 'luck' or 'ability', the statistics need to be looked
          at:
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          In 2004, the US had an average income of $41400US ($64703NZ) while New
          Zealand had an average income of $20310US ($31747NZ). That's right,
          the average income of the US is double of that of New Zealand.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          I'm not trying to show off or anything; my point is that the US is a
          land of opportunity because there is a different atmosphere of
          competition and hard work.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          In California, school was all about competition. You had to get better
          than a B (85%) on every test to stay in the top class, and that isn't
          easy. I had a friend who was scared to tell his parents that he got
          less than 90% on a Biology exam.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          I must admit that it's to the other extreme, but the lack of
          competitive attitude and the idea of "she'll be right..." has caused
          New Zealand to fail to achieve its potential. Of course, I'm speaking
          in generalisations. There is a group of extraordinary New Zealanders
          who manage to break through this lacking atmosphere to reach their
          full potential. And I hope to be one of them, one day.

          I went to the theatre and it was packed with 13-15 year olds. I always
          wanted it to be less of a spoof movie and more like the original
          _Scary Movie_ (more violent and sexually vulgar) so that those damn
          kids wouldn't keep laughing at the wrong times. Oh, well.

          I can't really make any analytical commentary of it, as all allusions
          to other films are parodies and are meant to be blatent and obvious.

          One thing that I can say is that there wasn't enough of Leslie
          Nielsen, the king of spoof acting. If you like watching parody films
          such as _Airplane!_ and _the Naked Gun_, you'll remember Nielsen's
          great contributions to the spoof genre. As the President of the US of
          A, Nielsen brought back this amazing humour, but I must say that there
          wasn't enough of it.

          I know it's an old film, but I've been wanting to see it because I
          love Natalie Portman (films), if you didn't know.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          Natalie Portman was great, but then again, I'm biased.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          What I loved about the film was Portman's character, "Alice". The
          character had the irony that while being the most honest and virtuous
          character, she had the least socially acceptable occupation (as a
          stripper).
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          "Alice"'s real name is Jane Jones, and that's what she calls hersefl
          when she's a stripper. But when she meets Dan (played by Jude Law),
          she takes on the pseudonym of "Alice Ayres", and stops being a
          stripper. When she strips for Larry (played by Clive Owen), she
          returns to New York with her dyed hair and her real name. But every
          time she's around Dan, she has a natural hair colour, has a job as a
          cafe waitress, and calls herself "Alice". What I'm trying to say is
          that since her coloured hair and wigs and stripping job are linked to
          her real name, those things are what defines her.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          I must say, she makes a damn fine stripper, and apparently there were
          deleted shots of full frontal nudity. Hah hah... Calum knows what I'm
          talking about.

          I saw _V for Vendetta_ today, just like I said I would. Damn, Natalie
          Portman's hot -- even with a shaved head. (I have a thing for shaved
          heads, you may know.)
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          First of all, I loved it. There are three reasons why I loved it:
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">1. Natalie Portman is hot, and a damn good actress.</p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">2. Hugo Weaving is cool, and a damn good actor.</p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          3. The Wachowskis are geniuses, and damn good writers.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          This film has reaffirmed my beliefs that Natalie Portman is my
          favourite actress and Hugo Weaving is my favourite actor. And the
          Wachowskis made my favourite movie back in 1999.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          I'm only going to say one more thing about the film, before I get into
          the philosophical ideas which underline it. I loved _the Matrix_ for
          reasons including great action, lots of special effects, and deep
          philosophical ideas. But one big reason why I loved _the Matrix_ was
          because the Wachowskis packed so much symbolism and meaning into every
          bit of the script that every time you watch it, you pick something new
          up, despite having watched it hundreds of times. For example, at the
          beginning of the Matrix, when the police officers break into the room
          where Trinity is on the computer, there are three torches shining on
          her, create a triangular shape, on the wall. This is obviously linked
          to the idea of the Trinity. Damn good stuff.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          In _V for Vendetta_ they put in just as much depth into the script.
          For example, near the beginning of the film, when asked by Evey
          Hammond (played by the distractingly beautiful Natalie Portman) who we
          was, V (masterfully played by the brilliant Hugo Weaving) makes a
          monologue littered with words starting with 'V'. In fact, he uses 55
          words beginning with 'V'. This is interesting because this can loosely
          be translated to the Roman numerals "VV", assuming that you consider
          each digit, rather than the whole number (which would be "LV"). What
          else is interesting is that 55 is equal to 5 x 11 -- the 5th of the
          11th is the 5th of November, which is the date of Guy Fawkes' attempt
          on the Parliament, and also the date when V blows up the Old Bailey,
          and then Parliament is blown up a year later. Damn good stuff.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          Now for deeper things. The first question that you walk away with
          after watching this film is "Terrorist or Freedom-fighter?". Like Rob
          has said, this is rather late to be asking this question, as it has
          been asked and over-asked for the last several years. And so, I find a
          different but related question: "Is it justifiable if you use violence
          to do something good?"
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          Let's do some role-playing. There is a generic bad guy who is about to
          kill two innocent people, and the only way you can stop him is to kill
          him. Do you kill him? Most will answer yes. Now here's a similar, but
          much tougher question: There is a generic bad guy who is about to kill
          two innocent people, and the only way you can stop him is to kill an
          innocent person yourself. Do you kill the innocent person to save the
          two other innocent people? You can't just look at it logically and say
          "Which is the lesser evil?" because you are the one making the choice
          on which set of innocents die. Ponder...
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          But that's no where near as interesting as one of the philosophical
          themes or motifs (or whatever the hell they call them) of the film:
          coincidence. Many of the characters of the film, especially V, don't
          believe in the notion of coincidence: "There is no such thing as
          coincidence, just the illusion of coincidence." But if you do not
          believe in coincidence, then you must believe in something connecting
          events, whether it be Fate or God or Gaia. Do you believe that you
          have Free Will to choose what to do with your life, or do you believe
          that every choice you make is not really a choice, but just causality
          playing its role on the neurons in your brain, causing you to make a
          certain 'choice' because of the way your brain is wired? I would hate
          to live with the idea that everything is run by causality.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          I'm just going to ramble on a tangent for just a moment longer. The
          idea of causality is flawed, as it implies that every event is caused
          by a stimulus, which in turn would be its own event. This means that a
          giant tree of events would exist and there must've been an initial
          event at the start of time (ie. the Big Bang) which was caused by
          something. Either something outside of the existence of the universe
          from 'before' the existence of the universe must have started the Big
          Bang.

          Irony #2 of the evening: Rebellion is socially cool.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          Elvis Presley, Eminem, and even Michael Jackson used rebellion to
          increase the volume of their image and succeeded. Elvis Presley is
          famous for going on the Ed Sullivan show without any pants on. (They
          had to film him from the waist up.)
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          But in the sense that rebellion is non-conformity and popularity is
          conformity, you arrive to the conclusion that the contradiction is too
          great for the rebellion to be honest.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">There are four types of people in this world:</p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          1. The first group is all the people who do something that is socially
          "cool" because everyone else is doing it. This is blatant conformity.
          This includes all the 3rd Form girls with short shorts and short
          skirts at Edgefest, who stand out in the foyer the whole time, because
          the only reason they went was to socialise instead of listen to music.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          2. The second group is all of the people who say "Fuck Edgefest"
          because everyone else is saying it. Sadly, this is blatant conformity.
          I must admit that I hate these people more -- the people who call
          themselves non-conformists, but are actually conforming to the idea of
          non-conformity (if that makes sense).
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          3. The third group is all of the people who go to Edgefest because
          they honestly like POD and the Presidents of the USA. This group is
          all of the people who wore a t-shirt and jeans to Edgefest. These are
          what I call honest non-conformists. They go to Edgefest -- not to
          socialise, but to listen to damn good music. I would like to consider
          myself in this group, but I did stand in the foyer during the crappy
          music.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          4. The fourth and most interesting group is all the people who say
          "Fuck Edgefest" and mean it. They say "fuck" not because it's
          rebellious, but because they mean it. These are the guys who are
          willing to take on the world over what type of music they listen to.
          So... cool... in an ironic kind of way.

          English blog. As most of you know, and are probably doing the same, I
          will critique what I read and watch here as requested for this year.

          Steriogram hit it big with "Walkie-Talkie Man" to become international
          stars in the musical world, especially when "Walkie-Talkie Man" was
          selected as the 'spokes-song' for the international Apple IPod ad
          campaign, and when the music video for "Walkie-Talkie Man" (directed
          by Michael Gondry, who's famous for directing _Eternal Sunshine for
          the Spotless Mind_) was nominated for an MTV Music Video Award, which
          is considered the highest achievement you can get for a music video
          (the award, not the nomination).

        <div class="key"></div>

          Schmack is the Steriogram album that rides the 'Walkie-Talkie' wave,
          with the hit at the wheel at track 2. But this isn't like all those
          other bands which make one or two top hits and then fizzle out. Most,
          if not all, of this CD is great to listen to, and never gets boring,
          except for maybe 'Walkie-Talkie Man' which reaches its limit when
          you've memorised all the fast-paced lyrics without using the internet.
          Other great songs on it include 'Go' and 'Tsunami', which was written
          before Boxing Day (December 26th, for all you Americans) has no
          relation to the devastating catastrophe that hit the world at the turn
          of the year.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          Of all the songs on the CD, my favourite would obviously be
          'Walkie-Talkie Man' because that song is on a completely different
          level of excellence compared to the other songs. Not that the other
          songs are sub-par, they're brilliant. 'Walkie-Talkie Man' is just
          better than brilliant. But other than 'Walkie-Talkie Man', my
          favourite would definitely be 'Tsunami'.
        </p>
        <div class="key"></div>
        <p class="value">
          On a personal note, it's cool to see a New Zealand band do so well on
          the world stage, and is just more evidence that all talent comes from
          New Zealand and that New Zealand rules the world, or the future of the
          world, at least.

        <div class="key"></div>

          It's a great CD and although I haven't got it yet (I'm borrowing a

          getting it too.

          As I've just completed my homework for tonight, I smile and frown,
          knowing that I'm finally at my level of achievement and torture. I'm
          at a standard which I've been climbing to get back to, ever since I
          left California all those years ago. But now things are different. I
          may not be swimming as much anymore, but I have a job now, and I play
          multiple instruments, and sing with a barbershop quartet chorus now.
          Two more years until my hard work in this endless pit of a hole called
          "college" (or in American: "high school") will be paid off.

          Earth to use them. Now I need some sleep.

          Where was I? Oh, yes. "SDF". It was New Year's Eve, two years ago,
          when I decided to document my fabulous* life. Well, obviously I was
          distracted from the fact that my life was utterly boring, except for
          when I saved my brother from the jellyfish, but that's a story for
          another campfire. I would spend two and a half hours every Saturday
          writing and formatting my newsletter to bore the public with. (Writing
          took half an hour and formatting took the rest.) The problem was that
          I would try to turn it from a page document into a page image, which
          was stressful, especially with a lack of understanding of all the
          processes.

          Anyway, after fifteen people or so gave up putting up with it and got
          new e-mail addresses, I realised that it would only work if I was
          James Bond or Santa Claus or someone like that with an interesting
          life. (Actually, Santa would probably have a boring life, just
          sleeping and manufacturing, except for the odd rush at the end of the
          year.) But now that my life is getting interesting, other than just
          being "homework, homework, homework" like most guys back in
          California, I might have something to offer. You guys can let me know
          when I'm getting boring. I refer to you because I know that you're

          y'all. I'm going to keep this blog relatively casual, unlike some of
          my other writings. My writing is often rather formal, although I hate
          "Formal Writing" in English. In all my writing (except for this one,)
          I call my "mum and dad" my "mother and father". I even talk like that.
          The main reason was that I didn't like being laughed at in NZ for
          saying "mom" and I didn't like being laughed at in California for
          saying "mum".

          which is the capital of NZ and also the new film-making centre of the
          world, amateur film-making at least. I go to school in the middle of
          the city. An all-boys school with uniforms. The problems with an
          all-boys school with uniforms:

          They go on about how "recent studies prove that boys do better when
          there aren't girls to distract them", but I say "bollocks!" (Actually,
          I don't say "bollocks", but it's such a fun word to say.) I've been to
          a co-ed school with many pretty girls and I must say that... oh,
          sorry. I thought I saw a pretty girl.

          The uniforms aren't that bad. I just became a senior at my school, so

          I like to make amateur films, but would like to start doing it
          part-time professionally. You know, with a profit. When I make films,
          I get my high from the whole production process, not the art, like my
          friends. That's why I can spend six and a half hours non-stop in one
          night writing my screenplay. I'm fascinated by all the different jobs
          of all the technicians you see the names of when you squint at the end
          of a movie, when you're looking for your friend's uncle, who
          "supposedly" worked in that movie. (That was a long sentence.)

          This blog is called "F @ T M @ T" because if you replace the '@' with
          "at", you get "fattmatt" which originated from one of the short films
          I worked on. First of all, the reason why I used '@' is because I
          figured out that I could spell my name "Matt" with three characters,
          which I needed to figure out how to do when I once got a hi-score on
          some arcade game. M@T. Matt. Anyway. We were at my friend George's
          house, and we had a rugby ball and a video camera. So we naturally
          decided to make a horror film about a seriel killer getting revenge on
          me because he didn't get to play rugby. As you would.

          We were filming one of the last scenes, and the sun was beginning to
          go down. We filmed the silhouette of the killer crossing against the
          white wall of the house. In the corner, there I am, crying because one
          of the other kids beat me up because I sucked at rugby. Along comes
          the killer and whacks my guts in and out as if the blanket stuffed
          under my sweater did any good in protecting me.

          When Dan, my fellow beater of an actor, would bludgeon me with the

          beating me full contact. Out of self-preservation, like any sane
          person, I instinctively pulled my hands in front to protect me.
          Subconsciously, I was pulling my hands forwards, and consciously, I
          was pulling them back, not wanting to get them hit. It was funny
          wiggly dance, like the mix between a chicken with convulsions, and a
          boy with his foot jammed in an escalator.
